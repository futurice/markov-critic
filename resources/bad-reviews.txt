Exposed is a mess and completely forgettable but perhaps it's more interesting as a lost movie with its true form caught between the demands of its financier and the vision of its original creator
In certain mutilated pictures you can detect the lineaments of greatness Consider Orson Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons Here that's not the case
'Exposed' is confusing and very difficult to follow It ends up being a downer mess -- despite interesting turns by Keanu Reeves and Ana de Armas
Awfully silly - and just plain awful
The confused heel-dragging mystery drama Exposed suggests an especially dour arty episode of Law  Order SVU minus any reasons to keep watching
Cliched thriller mixes cop story supernatural elements
feels like two disparate ideas scrambled together in a way that's never convincing
Has a grimy off-kilter charm not seen since the heyday of 's exploitation
What a strange and frustrating mess this is
Exposed is a film suffering from blunt force trauma to the head
With Reeves in energy-saving mode the troubled cop and corruption routines simmer but never come to the boil
Reeves appears to only have two expressions sad face and need-a-pee face
What is being released is a baffling hodge-podge of a movie full of contradictory elements Bits of it seen in isolation are effective and atmospheric but the plotting is tangled and confused
It's clearly intended as a magical-realist take on very genuine social conflicts but the result in this edit at least is a trial to sit through
To call it disjointed is an understatement Exposed is unintelligible It feels like two completely different movies inelegantly Frankensteined together
Incomprehensibly disjointed and stunningly dull
A grim-faced Keanu Reeves looks bewildered throughout Exposed and you can only sympathise
Carries a complex convoluted narrative that attempts to cover too much ground balancing a myriad of themes
How did they get it so wrong How could they remake the beloved s action classic Point Break with such ineptitude and so little affection
It fully deserves to be played on a loop silently in extreme-sports goods shops everywhere
Whereas the original was filled with humour and gung-ho machismo this Fast and Furious-style update is a joyless experience
We have no emotional connection with these characters nor do we care whether they survive or not
Steer well clear of this flatly disappointing remake as it seems hell-bent on stripping out everything that made the original movie so much fun
Pointless Heartbreaking
It's so unbelievably self-important with occasionally genuine and hazardous stunt work badly compromised by the annoying ponderousness of it all meaning that we wind up simply not caring who's risking their lives or who wants to get into whose pants
An adrenaline-fuelled but empty rehash that flies close enough to Bigelow's movie to remind you how much you'd much rather be watching the original
Director Ericson Core has ditched the fun of the Patrick SwayzeKeanu Reeves original and replaced it with soulless action scenes
The stunts are impressive The rest is a wash out
This is a high-grade action thriller that -- dare I suggest it -- redeems the Point Break brand And yes there's definitely room for a sequel
Point Break More like Point Miss
Bracey's emotionally scarred Johnny Utah is so wooden he makes Keanu look like Kenneth Branagh
We're left scratching our head wondering what it was all for
Core revels in the beauty of nature and the danger of taming it but showing such is meaningless if the plot is so weak it barely strings the destinations together
Relentless action cannot dispel the toxic levels of claptrap that stink up this po-faced slow-witted remake
This iteration of Point Break effectively serves as a blueprint of exactly how not to reboot an action film
A complete failure Who would've thought Full review in Spanish
Point Break aspires to be a decent remake but winds up being one of the most boring action films ever made
If you like to see people pushing themselves to the physical brink parts of the movie will absolutely hold your attention If only the plot was that compelling
A comedy that's neither clever enough nor sufficiently over the top
Despite its flagrant attempts to mimic what works in the comedies by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg it's never particularly funny
The problem is that a movie like this - limp lazy generic - just doesn't cut it at a time when American indies and television offer sharp witty satisfyingly complex takes on the Facebook generation
Shot like a typically ugly Adam Sandler effort and so clumsily stitched together that it feels as if large plot chunks litter the editing-room floor
Not only is this ensemble unemployment comedy labored and witless but it bears the unmistakable scars of a protracted and ultimately failed struggle in the editing room
It's hard work finding work these days is it not Not according to Get a Job
At its sloppy heart this is meant to be an affirming movie but the filmmakers could have taken a cue from one line of dialogue Don't just feel special Be special
Clearly the economy has given Get a Job a reason to be sour But there's no excuse for being so sexist
The imperfect work mired in storage all this time gets a well-deserved spin
Get a Job is nothing special
Not only is this a movie without any guts it doesn't have much of a brain either
Predictable workplace comedy has drugs sex swearing
After a viewing it's obvious why the producers lost interest in releasing it
Get A Job points to either massive studio compromise or a filmmaker who has somehow lost the mastery of his once-auspicious occupation
Get A Job's primary problem is that it doesn't know if it wants to be a realistic look at millennials and the current economy or go for the cheap gag about the jive-talking pimp renting out a sleazy motel
This long-shelved comedy proves a disappointing mix of onscreen talent uneven social satire and juvenile humor
What makes Get A Job so infuriatingly bad rather than the kind of film you hate and then completely forget about is the all-star cast that it has at its disposal and disgracefully wastes
A brutally cynical largely unfunny film fueled by muddled social commentary
Neither a contemporary workplace satire nor an insightful lampoon of the laziness of overprivileged millennials
Toby and co come across as a pale anti-intellectual imitation of the college-aged friends in Donna Tartt's The Secret History - a novel that explores the roots of its characters' moral recklessness rather than just chalking it up to teenage feelings
Toby is so un-self-aware that his journey seems like mere obtuseness what the film has to say about youthful degeneracy is less than zero
Nearly everything about The Preppie Connection - from the high-school class war to the flat explanatory narration - has been cribbed from other better films
This film fails even to evoke the 's in costumes soundtrack or other atmospherics
A shallow and profoundly unexciting true-life account of one student's brief reign as a campus drug lord
As written Toby is somewhat of an empty slate and Mann doesn't do much to fill in the blanks
A dramatized real-life scandal of s prep-school drug dealing plays like a tepid compilation of fictive cliches in The Preppie Connection
Extraction constantly tries to score a flashy TKO - but never lands a decent body blow
Very low-rent with a phoned-in Bruce Willis performance However director Steven C Miller and game stars Gina Carano and Kellan Lutz contribute a few solid action scenes
There are a couple of passable fight scenes including one in a biker bar But the plot is ridiculous the bad guys are uninteresting and the script is so dull you'll want to check your emails during the screening
Extraction's  not by any stretch of the imagination good But at least it doesn't waste everybody's time
An unexceptional action picture with old-fashioned ideas about what it means to be a man
There are I guess some decently staged fight scenes including clever use of some pool balls but they in no way make up for having to sit there and watch Lutz garble out warmed-over tough guy dialogue
The action-thriller Extraction may not be about tooth removal but for all the fun it proves it might as well be
It's a rare movie that can't be saved by Bruce Willis single-handedly killing all the bad guys And yet here it is Extraction
It takes confidence to put out a movie whose single-word title is also the procedure by which a dentist gets rid of a rotten tooth
Extraction is an exhaustively paint-by-numbers affair and nobody is more bored with it than Willis
Extraction I'd rather have my teeth pulled by diseased evil monkeys
Some stylish touches can't rescue a thin concept that's riddled with cliches
Bad acting clunky cinematography and editing heavy violence and a less-than-genius screenplay make this a totally disposable action movie not even recommendable to die-hard Willis ans
Zariwny lacks Roth's love for peeling flesh and tar-colored blood-geysers making this all feel weirdly pointless
Scene for scene line for line gag for gag it's basically the same movie And the original was no masterpiece to begin with
Travis Zariwny predictably scrubs all the edges and eccentricities down however fashioning another impersonally polished cover jam
A remake-sorry reboot-of the  movie of the same title in which attractive young people contract a super flesh-eating virus is not surprisingly more of the same
Who benefits from the existence of this film
Roth isn't exactly known for being critically defensible or for exercising directorial restraint but Travis Z somehow manages to up the gore quotient
The Cabin Fever remake is pointless primarily concerned with serving the financial interests of its producers not meeting the needs of franchise fans
I've you've seen Eli Roth's Cabin Fever there's no need to watch this  remake If you HAVEN'T seen Roth's Cabin Fever start there and re-read my previous sentence
This dud sets a new standard for the term 'pointless remake'
Roth's charcoal sense of humor is missing the cruel irony lacking its hellish zing
Unfortunately director Travis Z doesn't quite have Roth's sense of humor about the whole thing and takes it all very seriously
A superior remake even if it is still abysmal nonsense
It feels flat throughout the bloodletting disappoints and perhaps most damning of all it neuters pancakes
There just is no point whatsoever to any of this childish witless nonsense
Unlike many horror fans I'm usually open to remakes but Cabin Fever's humorless overly reverential redo might set a new standard for pointlessness
The whole thing is a likability vacuum
The symptoms are familiar Nausea fatigue and impatience accompanied by excessive eye roll and exasperation Yup Must be Cabin Fever a mind-numbing disease once believed eradicated
In form and content plotting and politics the film is egregiously disguised as a smug inspirational piece but in reality it is the cinematic equivalent of being offered free hugs from Donald Trump
A strange and relaxed film that feels like the Levinson of the good old days Full review in Spanish
Rock the Kasbah hides a much more predictable and tedious story of redemption Full review in Spanish
We stand before a lazy piece of work that includes well established actors and avoids totally ridiculing itself because of its protagonist Bruce Willis being tough Kate Hudson showing off her beauty and an excellent soundtrack Full Review in Spanish
An interesting cast and premise that feels like a missed opportunity Full review in Spanish
Bill Murray is everything in this movie sadly it's not enough A weird and failed movie Full review in Spanish
Leaving aside the galloping misogyny 'Rock the Kasbah' just isn't remotely funny or smart
Turns out it's ruinously hard to raise a smile at IEDs and arms deals gone awry especially in a conflict that's still raging No doubt it's meant to be satire but it feels like profiteering
Rock the Kasbah feels likes the pathetic last wheezes of the Baby Boomer Entitlement Project Bro Division
On paper this could have been excellent as it stands it's painful and futile for all involved
Murray has rarely been so charmless in a movie
Singularly fails to charm - and even Murray's on faltering form
A resounding misfire
It's neither funny nor feelgood but its biggest crime is wasting Murray left trying to mine laughs from unfunny circumstances
Unfunny and also casually offensive
It's a strangely lacklustre film that's happy to plonk Murray in a vaguely interesting crisis situation -- in this case war-torn Afghanistan -- and just hope for the best
Barry Levinson's film loosely inspired by the true story of reality TV show Afghan Star comes at its subject matter from entirely the wrong direction
A dog's dinner of a movie which not even the usually reliable Bill Murray can raise above the level of confused cliched claptrap
Murray is entertaining but the plot seems entirely arbitrary with characters such as Kate Hudson's happy hooker Merci popping up without much rhyme or reason A real disappointment
Murray's performance really is one of very few saving graces in this truly underwhelming piece of cinema
Although handsomely crafted well-acted and made with transparently noble intentions Roland Emmerich's Stonewall is a movie that seems destined to please almost no one
Isn't a perfect movie by any means but the good intentions are there
Lends all new meaning to the phrase Roland Emmerich disaster movie
The Stonewall Riots deserved a better movie and unfortunately Emmerich was not the guy who was going to deliver it
It's a self-financed passion project from a man who might be the most financially successful out gay filmmaker ever We should be celebrating this but man oh man does he make it difficult
Irvine is with that tousled blonde hair and milky skin with its apple cheeks a beautiful ephebe with no more emotional resonance than if he were actually carved from a pillar of marble
This can't be the kind of equality that those Stonewall activists were fighting for the right to have their story turned into formulaic historical fiction as tedious as the kind about straight people
If someone set out to make an after-school special about street hustlers this would be it
The worst Quantum Leap ever
more than bad and worse than disappointing a tragic distortion of a vitally important story that insults the people it tries to honor and insults its audience as well
Where the social impact of the riots is lasting the impact of the movie is negligible
Almost everything that could go wrong does
It's a high school play-ready version of the riots a version more focused on outside characters and related inspiring lessons than even the riots themselves and wears the rosest-colored glasses about the dynamics of the era in which it took place
spends an excruciatingly long time on a happily ever after coda  minutes about Danny and not enough of what followed after the riots
The Stonewall Riots were a triumph for a marginalized community but Emmerich fails to convey the significance of the event in any meaningful fashion The subject matter deserves better and so do we
Stonewall is such a cataclysmic disaster of a film that I'm surprised nobody has called FEMA yet to help with all the damage it's done to the GLBTQ community
Despite the volatile subject matter Stonewall is a rather bland rendering
Disappointing gay-rights drama has sex language violence
Stonewall is a movie about a pivotal moment in LGBT history as filtered through the perspective of a fictional hunk of Wonder Bread named Danny who steps off a bus from Indiana and right into a central role in the Christopher Street scene
Compared to a genuinely rousing gay-rights historical drama like Milk  Stonewall falls considerably short
Sometimes the cast doesn't seem so sure it's a real movie and especially for the first act it feels like they shot everything in one take and left them all in the movie Maybe they were afraid to yell cut
So much is random and lame here handed little consideration before being committed to a hard drive Joe Dirt  is an awful film absolutely unwatchable and depressing
Precisely as good as it sounds
But even by the rather lofty modern standards of cynical pointless cash-ins Joe Dirt  is pronounced a sequel to a mild hit from nearly  years ago that even its most ardent defenders would be hard-pressed to justify
Pointless sequel isn't funny lots of profanity crude humor
At an egregious  minutes Joe Dirt  feels like a director's cut where every single moment of footage was carefully preserved no matter how pointless or unfunny or digressive it might be
You'd think that after  years they'd have more than stale fart jokes and weak callbacks to bits that weren't funny in the first place
JOE DIRT  BEAUTIFUL LOSER is not a good film In fact it is utterly terrible
Cusack says at one point I did what you do with a puzzle I stared at it until it made sense That I can guarantee you won't happen with Shanghai
Everything in Mikael Hfstrm's film is needlessly bloated to accommodate its status as an international prestige production
The film often feels like a drab collection of scenes where John Cusack disinterestedly questions attractive elusive Asian cast members
Shanghai isn't altogether awful but knowing that it has the potential to be so much better in the hands of a stronger director makes it a frustrating affair
Goes through all the motions of an old-school wartime spy pic with plenty of technical competence but zero panache the filmic equivalent of a bar band working through one last Skynyrd cover just before last call
A morass of clichs and orientalism salvaged from the Hollywood backlot debris of  years ago
Cusack does his best to evoke compassion for his character and he is quick on his feet whether trying to woo Anna or outsmart his captors But none of it is enough to highly recommend Shanghai
It's all intriguing and breathtaking along with a mournful lovely score by Klaus Badelt but not enough to compensate for the miserable writing
How many times does John Cusack have to prove he is no leading man In Shanghai he comes off as Sam Spade with chopsticks
Hfstrm directs it like he's sucking too hard on a cigarette in a quick over-and-done-with style that results only in fitful coughs of smoke
Director Mikael Hafstrom and a fine cast and crew have made a film that's elegant and gauche in roughly equal measure
A turgid anemic already five-year-old motion picture from Swedish director Mikael Hfstrm
Don't look for plausibility in this World War II epic set in China just enjoy the lavishly produced exotic and often exciting ride
It is hampered by weak writing and a badly executed story line
Under Mikael Hfstrm's visually clunky rhythmless direction it's a snooze of epic sameness choppy action scenes a blankly stern Cusack and too many allegiance shifts to count or care for
You might be forgiven for expecting either an unfairly squelched masterpiece or an unholy mess The movie is neither although it falls closer to the mess side of the table
Even if an uncredited editor were hired to make clear sense of these pieces the film wouldn't work
Cusack is halfway between Humphrey Bogart and Jimmy Stewart and the result doesn't come together
Written by the talented Hossein Amini and clearly inspired by spy and detective movies of the s this seems to have been a labor of love But SHANGHAI is so convoluted that it eventually becomes lost
The true-life historical background is more compelling than the fictional melodrama
That none of it makes any sense is not a problem but the failure to raise the temperature despite endless shootouts punch-ups car chases et al is a fatal flaw
There are few surprises and no-one really to warm to
The film is as soulless as Agent  is conforming to all the mediocre-thriller cliches the action zips from Salzburg to Berlin to Singapore for next to no coherent reason with little originality
Someone needs to put out a contract on this franchise
So badly based on a video game that with every new level of bland cool or serious silliness you'll wish Mr  would scissor-jump barrels to blow Donkey Kong's brains out or cart-chase Super Mario--anything to make this exciting at some bullet-point
We've revisited a franchise that failed to get off the ground with its preceding  endeavour - and one that could struggle to do so yet again
It seems like eight short years ago I reviewed a movie called Hitman that was based on a video game Oh wait a minute It was And I did
A good Hitman film should appeal to fans of the source material engage thrill-seeking cineastes and at the very least satisfy theatregoers who want to sit in a dark room and be entertained On all of these counts Agent  fails irredeemably
It's really more of a miss than a hit man
The movie is garbage somehow simultaneously boring and irritating
Works pretty well as unintentional amusement whenever it goes completely insane Unfortunately it's mostly just inane and that's not much fun
In Hitman Agent  Bach doesn't really offer anything Full review in Spanish
A slick efficient and utterly banal piece of global cinema product
The seduction is his perfection his ability to function without the clutter of emotion It's why we buy magazines like Real Simple and watch Hoarders so we can imagine for one moment that we're capable of overcoming our human flaws and messy house
By the final frame you'll be grateful it's game over
Where HItman was happy to be derivative of the genre movies that inspired the game Agent  takes those inspirations and pushes them to gleefully insane degrees
Hitman Agent  does deliver sleek production values and a stand-out performance from Hannah Ware Other than that it's a nonsensical story that feels as if it was written by a -year-old who plays too many video games
Unfortunately while Hitman Agent  may offer a passable diversion for the action fans among us for everyone else it's best avoided
The plot is generic in the extreme and the dialogue and acting barely disguises the fact that it's really just a series of not very exciting set-pieces strung together
Rupert Friend plays an assassin even deadlier than Homeland's Peter Quinn But his very indestructibility means the story's formulaic action never gets particularly gripping
Feels like a long trailer for the sequel that may never come Full review in Spanish
This one starts off better than the previous films with a reasonably intelligent script sprightly direction by Trank a great comic-book noir look and pleasant rapport among the stars
An epic fail in Hollywood's comic book movie universe this not-so-fantastic flop is so bad it could send the whole genre on a downward spiral What a mess
The film drains the spark from four talented young actors with clunky dialogue and a crushingly dull narrative The special effects aren't that special either
Ultimately Fantastic Four comes off as a laboured setup to a sequel that's predictably already in the works That of course raises another mammoth question who the hell will want to see it
Creio j ser hora de o Cinema desistir de levar o Quarteto Fantstico para as telonas
An above-average comic-book adaptation
Until the special effects take over in the final act this is an unusually gritty grounded superhero thriller with characters who are so believable that the wacky science almost seems to make sense
This much-reviled reboot represents a legitimate attempt to imagine a superhero origin story as a cautionary science-fictionhorror yarn of the type 'The Fly' 'First Man into Space' that likely influenced Lee and Kirby in the first place
Maybe it's time to just accept that these characters will simply never work on film
There are so many things wrong with Fantastic Four    that you could never squeeze them all into a conventional film review
For now the only big screen on which Fantastic Four deserves to be seen is the one in your living room on a Saturday afternoon on Syfy
I can't help but feel that this was another type of film but someone put his hands on it and it all went to hell Full review in Spanish
features subpar visual effects and one-dimensional characters along with a story that lacks emotional depth or any meaningful subtext leading to the obligatory trumped-up finale
Despite the best efforts of its talented cast this joins Terminator Genisys as this summer's big disappointments Far from fantastic
Two distinctly different approaches to filmmaking are employed here and neither of them manages to eke out a victory over the other
A jumble of predictable but also incoherent plot turns dreadful dialogue and unfortunate visual choices
Laboriously reworks one of the most well-known origin stories in superhero comics
Though undeniably ambitious in spots this beloved Marvel property - as produced by Fox - feels stitched together and disengaged
It's a real shame that a likable ensemble has been squandered in this reboot It feels like these four leads could've been fantastic but in reality they're a pretty unremarkable bunch
Some Kind Of Beautiful has a fine cast but they're stuck doing shtick
Sometimes the film wants to be light farce all repartee and two-dimensional characters other times it wants to be a contender with deathbed scenes and motivating lectures on romantic poetry At all times it's a tremendous waste of talent
The sentimental side of the back half of the film doesn't fit with the bedroom farce sensibilities going before
A string of hackneyed situations and faux edgy humor you wouldn't find on even the worst episode of Frasier
A -minute film that seems to last for three hours  one of the worst films to sport the label romantic comedy
The problem however is that the script by Matthew Newman doesn't do enough to make Richard either lovable or reprehensible
Mainly the comic outcomes of these setups are painfully predictable and when they aren't  they border on the offensive
The Hollywood romantic comedy hits an astonishing new low with this disastrous pairing for Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek
An entertaining film full of predictable situations that can be sometimes boring Full review in Spanish
It's a misguided tale of redemption that's driven almost completely by coincidences without a hint of realistic grounding
Tom Vaughan's film never really takes off and given to a poor script most scenes feel redundant and are barely watchable due to Brosnan and the rest of the cast's talent Full review in Spanish
A romantic comedy full of poorly executed cliches of the genre Full review in Spanish
Painfully cliched romcom is full of sex and profanity
The only good thing about this movie is Hayek's performance She proves again she has good comedic timing Full review in Spanish
Maybe the script sounded like a good idea but it's definately a bad execution Full review in Spanish
We all like Brosnan and one is mortified to be ageist but for this to have been even slightly romantic funny or bearable the male lead -- and everyone else -- wanted to be much younger
One generation's silver fox is another's creepy old sex pest and Pierce Brosnan doesn't have the comic chops or even the facial expressions to bridge the gap here
Pierce Brosnan's recent career is not a thing of beauty Yet again he has plumped for a mildly embarrassing past-its-sell-by-date part
Boring contrived and witless
Rather than Pierce giving a lecture on how to be a better person he should have stuck to bedding the half-sisters played by Jessica Alba and Salma Hayek
It inflates the meta conceit already borderline overblown of a pop-obsessed sex-negative serial killer to excessive but trite proportions
The masked Slasher is voiced by Andy Dick because nothing gives weight to your criticism of reality TV like having it stated by a guy who appeared in Celebrity Wife Swap
A good-looking effort but offers no threat positioning itself as dangerous chic and wise when it's mostly muddled and poorly edited
Even the most talentless and narcissistic fame seekers on reality television are not nearly as vile reprehensible or worthless as a film that actively wishes harm on them
This bloody attempt at satire suffers from comparisons to other movies that did the same thing much better but also from a flat facile approach that renders everything slick soulless and vacuous
Fairly awful and useless
As a movie Saving Christmas is not good But as a teaching aid for congregants about having their fruitcake and eating it too Sure why not Go nuts guys
How do you prove a horse is an animal Because I like Sweden That's the style of absurd logic that happens in Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas
With a smile so wide and laughter that sounds so forced you half-expect the camera to pull back to reveal hostage takers Mr Cameron explains how several facets of the holiday - the tree Santa Claus gifts - have roots in religious tradition
This may be one of the least artful holiday films ever made Even devout born-again Christians will find this hard to stomach
Virtually everything about this production feels thrown together
Perhaps the only Christmas movie I can think of especially of the religious-themed variety that seems to flat-out endorse materialism greed and outright gluttony
More like Explaining Christmas and not in a particularly entertaining or well-made way Full Content Review -- Sex Profanity etc -- for Parents also available
Cameron's preferred tool of engagement is a prybar applied to your eyelids with an indelicate hand
Had Saving Christmas run any longer Cameron would no doubt have found a way to find the divinity in Frosty Rudolph the Grinch peppermint bark the Elf on the Shelf frosted cranberry hand soap and Mr Hanky the Christmas Poo
It is The Room of Christmas movies Actually The Room is more enjoyable But you get the idea
Hot cocoa is referenced no fewer than nine times Cameron talks about the drink as though it were the trump card of his entire argument as though dropping a microphone And COCOA
Actor encourages grumpy Christians to embrace the season
The worst holiday movie ever made
A latter-day variation on the Prodigal Son parable providing proof that God still works in mysterious ways
This evangelical Dear America Letters Home From Vietnam by way of The Dukes of Hazzard takes a mighty ridiculous route to righteousness
A clumsily told story of friendship and wartime remembrance that has a tough time serving up a halfway believable moment let alone a moving and powerful testimony about the Lordship of Jesus Christ
Faith of Our Fathers gets high points for good intentions but loses most of them for execution
It's obnoxious to say the least to use the Vietnam War as an excuse to affirm the importance of telling all and sundry about Jesus at all times ie testifying under all circumstances
Faith of Our Fathers doesn't work and not because of its Christian message
The acting is atrocious the dialogue a disgrace and the props look like they were designed by a conscripted middle-school drama club
Amateurishly faltering Christian-based saga that preaches to the choir
Message about heroics and bravery comes too late in the movie to overcome the mess that preceded it
War drama has combat scenes heavy-handed message
The over reliance on slo-mo also makes every action sequence repetitive even with some semi-decent fight choreography on display The tacked-on love story is so shallow and perfunctory it's almost laughable
Big sci-fi ideas done on a budget doesn't quite translate into a compelling thriller
As an actor Clarke is likeable but his film is derivative distracted and desperately in need of a better denouement
Once you've worked out that the plot is even more ridiculous than you feared there's not much to hold your interest
Has Noel Clarke directed this baffling unconvincing sci-fi just to show the world his chiselled rock-hard pecs
Hilariously naff science-fiction mularkey that appears to have been cobbled together like Frankenstein's monster from the discarded body parts of Total Recall The Matrix Source Code and countless others
The Anomaly has all the ingredients of a winning formula in the wrong measures
Saddled with unsayable dialogue and variable special effects it's a corny and hackneyed film with ideas well above its station that underwhelms from the start
Admittedly in directorstar Noel Clarke's low-budget sci-fi actioner the acting and script do provoke surprise both are so bad you find yourself wondering if what's unfolding is some kind of parody
Best described as a noble failure
A smug risible and far-from-anomalous attempt to beat Hollywood at its own game from a talent whose commendable reach continues to exceed his grasp
Following the Roger Corman exploitation rule book to the letter The Anomaly wrings maximum bangs for bucks from its tight budget while unashamedly showcasing the director's buff assets
One day the world will find out what Noel Clarke has on Universal Pictures and it's going to change the film industry forever
It's a nifty idea - especially in terms of structure - but that's about it with Clarke's direction proving as flat as his performance
Noel Clarke never shuns an opportunity to show off his buff body but displays little of the intelligence or flair needed to pull off his film's mind-stretching conceits
There's infinitely more than one anomaly to be found in The Anomaly a thoroughly nonsensical futuristic sci-fi thriller that makes a case for the perils of vanity projects
The major players uniformly fail to bring their A-games
The instantly notorious propaganda film United Passions is the ultimate testament to FIFA's staggering insularity and tone-deafness
Tedious amateurish and hilariously ill-timed
As proof of corporate insanity it is a valuable case study
Badly paced with woodenly acted paperboard characters spouting expository captions throughout the early th-century portions
One of the most unwatchable films in recent memory a dishonest bit of corporate-suite sanitizing that's no good even for laughs
United Passions makes you believe we have yet to witness the true depths of FIFA's ego and arrogance
Comes across as a squirm-inducing heap of propaganda at its most self-congratulatory
United Passions is the unintentionally funniest movie of
Deceptive disgraceful and deplorable
Director Frdric Auburtin's movie is a mushy stakes-free drama that attempts to impress all the conventions of biographical cinema upon a self-impressed overview of business world maneuvering and horse-trading
Even without the cloud of the recent disturbing developments United Passions is a cringeworthy self-aggrandizing affair that mainly benefits from its unintentional camp value
All that cash flowing into Fifa's coffers and they spent it on this tripe
A bloated historical diorama of FIFA office-life highlights A ghastly stiff orgy of self-love It's like watching blank celluloid and hoping a movie will magically appear Warning you may consider melon-balling your eyes out
Utterly bizarre and heroically dull
One of those rare films so unfathomably ghastly you could write a better one while sitting through its interminable  minutes
Bland mismatched lovers drama that benefits from striking locations decent cast and a tone of exhausted resignation
Boy meets girl girl frees boy's spirit audience falls asleep - Safelight is a sluggish romantic drama that we've seen far too many times
There's just not much room to work with the abundance of clichs
Safelight would be better titled Lightweight
Safelight squanders the efforts of a talented cast who are unable to lift the material beyond its clichs
Does the world really need another indie film about lost souls living quiet lives of desperation in a heaven-forsaken one-horse town
Everything in writer-director Tony Aloupis' Safelight feels telegraphed
First-time filmmaker Tony Aloupis formerly frontman of the New Jersey rock band Shadows of Dreams serves up Americana like a stale slice of apple pie
Uneven would be a kind word for Safelight
An attractive cast can't rescue this well-meaning but slow sappy romantic triangle
To write off Safelight as just another generic romantic teen drama about wounded souls who find healing in each other's arms wouldn't do justice to its baffling ineptitude
Following a by the numbers Abused and downtrodden young couple finds a modicum of happiness in a cruel world through their affection for each other premise Safelight is about the friendship and the inevitably blossoming romance
Given that we've seen this story before and didn't like it then Safelight should perhaps just be called safe
A bland and unremarkable tale of sad souls and dead-end circumstances from first-time feature director Tony Aloupis
I hope Temple finds a way to stick around until such time as she figures out where she fits in best and what she's best at When that happens she is gonna lay waste
The scenery might make for a pleasant travelogue if only the screenplay took any risks or showcased any surprises between its bookend confrontations
It's genial with appealing stars and fair giggles
Hot pursuit loses it
Let's all just carry on with our lives now
It ostensibly shows two polar opposites transcending stereotypes to finding common ground but is so lazy laboured and retrograde that I winced throughout I'm still wincing now
Witherspoon and Vergara do have chemistry together but a lack of decent gags means this buddy comedy vehicle is running on empty
Both leads offer a diminished shtick Witherspoon flustered and prim Vergara flogging her zany Latina firecat routine from Modern Family
At a certain point films that present themselves as flat-out comedies should generate some actual laughs
Cooper is a rather pitiful caricature of a hapless blonde redeemed only by the actress's innate likeability which not even the crass script can totally suppress
You want to like the results but most of the time the zany circumstances and physical comedy feel too forced
Another in a long line of half baked festering Midnight Run wannabes
A concept film needs much more than the high-pitched goofiness of Hot Pursuit
Unfunny and anti-feminist
There's not much worse than a comedy with no laughs and Hot Pursuit is a movie where punchlines go to die
Even when the film finds something funny it runs the gag into the ground
You'll laugh a few times but Hot Pursuit fails to be the smart comedy it should've been especially given that it stars an Oscar-winning actress and the Emmy and Golden Globe-nominated star of one of TV's top comedies This movie feels beneath them
If justice was a real thing the Academy would be knocking on Reese Whiterspoon's door to take her Oscar back Full review in Spanish
One of those wannabe-crazy comedies where you almost feel sorry for the stars as they get up to such loudly dorky shenanigans or you would if they weren't so annoying
The only real joke in this so-called comedy is that any of the women who worked on it chose to make it at all
You won't laugh much and you're unlikely to remember it
Spectacularly misogynist Every single attempt at humor - all of which fail - comes from abusing and humiliating its central female characters as women
Either one of the most poorly edited features I've seen this year or director Rustam Branaman is trying to pull off a colossal cinematic prank
Branaman's script piles on low-level drama bad decisions and enough misdirection to make the film's baffling ending feel not just unearned but entirely unbelievable
Any Day falls into the painfully crowded trough between not-bad and seriously not-good movies
A clich-ridden heavy-handed redemptive drama written and directed by Rustam Branaman
A well-intentioned disaster only slightly redeemed by a committed performance by Sean Bean whose talent proves nowhere near enough to make this manipulative tripe more digestible
Everything in Any Day is portentous and presented as if it is loaded with meaning none of it is because everything is either so obvious or so arbitrary that nothing actually means anything
An earnest utterly predictable indie that wastes a couple of decent performances in service of a hackneyed and weak script
A sequel has a responsibility to cultivate its garden Paul Blart Mall Cop  never gets further than the fertilizer
This isn't much more than a fly's fart of a film the most microscopically tiny of afterthoughts
Paul Blart Mall Cop  may be forgettable but it's difficult to truly dislike
Maybe Paul Blart isn't spoofing John McClane after all maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what they're imitating
The only thing that stands out about this film is how hard it tries to be an average comedy full review in Spanish
It doesn't have enough laughs the fact that is a family comedy does not allow room for bold humor full review in Spanish
No more than an excuse for James to play out his affable brand of humour - mixing physical slapstick with a verbose running commentary of both grandiose and self-depreciating observations on life and himself
There are mediocre films and then there are films like Paul Blart Mall Cop  where the mediocrity is more or less the point
Paul Blart Mall Cop  doesn't believe in the worthiness of its own hero Why should we
A perfectly congenial innocuous goofball comedy It's not as funny as the first film but it is funny enoughthis chuckle-worthy little film has become subject to some of the most vitriolic reviews in recent memory it is difficult to figure out why
Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake that's hardly a recommendation
If you find yourself in front of a screen where Paul Blart Mall Cop  is playing you only have yourself to blame
It doesn't break new ground in any way but it relishes Kevin James hitting it for our pleasure as many times as he can-and sometimes that's enough
Kevin James' buffoonish charm and the obvious product placement quickly run cold
Surprising notes of meanness and bitterness
The Blart jokes hobble along again here What's new is an added layer of misjudgment eg tasing someone five times The only cringe to this comedy comes with the stereotypes a no-nonsense black woman who drops slang a snotty young Latino hotshot
Forget the whole Whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas spiel Officer Blart should have done us all a solid and stayed in Jersey with his Segway
Not about the every man hero it's about the fat slob working class and how we should laugh at them and not with them
As expected all the humour involves his bumping into things and falling over because he's fat which is apparently hilarious
This follow-up to the  original is even more terminally dumb and dopey with co-writer co-producer and star Kevin James hamming it up horribly
I'm very half-hearted about this
Performances are fine and the film is well made but it's too much of a hybrid to be successful
Noble in intention this story of slavery and the origin of John Newton's hymn Amazing Grace opens with style but then steadily sinks into messy theatricality overwhelmed by its own earnestness
Without all the music Freedom would be about  minutes long Further chop out all the conversations about Jesus please and it would be nothing but credits
Ambitious period piece without the budget or the script to cover as much of the Abolition Movement as it tries to fit in
Freedom's story could be so powerful on its own Samuel's escape is a nail-biter and the devastation of slavery is obvious Adding intentionally stirring scenes does nothing but blunt the impact of a harrowing pair of tales
A schmaltzy deeply sentimentalized drama about American slavery and the rise of the Underground Railroad
Though Gooding tries hard to look sincere and troubled often he appears slightly embarrassed It's no surprise Too bad so much talent is wasted here
The film tries to have the scope of  Years a Slave But it's ruined by the sanctimonious songs that turn the drama into a half-baked musical Much worse the filmmakers' need to show that not all whites employed in the slave trade were evil
The film leaves us with the impression that slaves' survival had more to do with sheer luck than dogged resilience
Freedom takes a compelling chapter in American history - the flight of slaves from Southern bondage to Canada via the Underground Railroad - and flattens its drama
The preaching is earnest and the intentions are good but the corn is high and the presentation is amateurish
This is one of those movies that is as dull as it is well-meaning and man is it ever well-meaning
Religious historical film has disturbing graphic violence
Peter Cousens' mawkish Freedom is an apologia for the white Christian people who helped slaves escape or at least wrote songs to make them feel better
The opposite of enlightenment the film hides its anxieties behind a mlange of third-rate grit and playful xenophobia
Dawn Patrol feels distended and awkwardly paced despite a lean -minute runtime
By the time the film gets to a genuinely interesting moment in the final scenes it will be hard for most viewers to stop stifling their laughter
Dawn Patrol has a lot on its plate and manages to drop it all
The film directed by veteran filmmaker Daniel Petrie Jr attempts to stuff too many elements into the premise
A repulsive and disgustingly manipulative roundrobin of revenge that veers from softcore porn to an emotionally ignorant parody of a family drama
A shamelessly derivative and preposterous would-be blockbuster that goofily fashions itself as a sweeping romance time-travel sci-fi tale and gallant period piece all at once
It's hard to root for love to bloom between a stock Strong Female Character and the nicest man in history
It's so deadly and unintentionally funny I hope that it practically defies description Mr Joff should go back to film school as soon as possible
Instead of evolving into intriguing lunacy The Lovers loses a critical battle with coherency
Time may bring good things to light but the  copyright suggests that delays have worked no such wonders for this film
Suckers for romance likely won't complain but this Josh Hartnett time-travel epic is nuts
There's a veil of artifice clinging to every aspect of The Lovers a thoroughly unconvincing time-traveling epic costume drama pairing a miscast Josh Hartnett and Bollywood beauty Bipasha Basu
The Lovers strives mightily to be a new Titanic for the Millennium but resoundingly fails at every turn
Flailing through centuries it lacks any meaningful connection between the two timelines
As one of the film's many forgettable characters so eloquently puts it This stinks worse than an oyster's fart
Joffe seems well aware that this is a story not worth telling  the filmmaking is so hopelessly uninspired that Hartnett's Scottish accent is somehow not its most glaring flaw
A slew of half-baked characters and a derivative white-man-in-a-foreign-land plot line make it hard to recommend despite a handful of inspired moments
If you're aching to see a tragic tearjerker romance then the only tears you will shed will be of frustration
This limply directed tale emerges as a case study of an all too familiar type of art crime the making of bad movies
Mr Travolta teeters between tough-guy menace and soulful artistic intensity but you don't ever believe that he can paint or that he can beat up a whole squad of younger bigger meaner dudes
Granted emotionality doesn't come in handy when dealing with a heist picture Yet underneath the thrills and near-misses is a surprisingly robust story about a father's commitment and care
Occasionally a movie comes along that's such an awkward compilation of ideas it fascinates The Forger a Boston-set melodrama involving cancer Impressionist art and deadbeat dads is only about half that good
In attempting to spin out its competing storylines the crime drama The Forger never quite gets a handle on either one
It never for a single moment makes a plausible case for its own existence
The plot is ridiculous but as a dysfunctional crime family drama The Forger has its moments Sheridan and Plummer are much better than the film
There's about an hour's worth of story in the The Forger a languid movie that's stretched thin to fill out the running time
What is happening If you check out The Forger you might well find yourself saying that time and again as the entertainingly terrible performances keep piling up while the plot dares you not to chuckle at the audacity of it all
The tension between grandfather and father and son is so fabricated and baseless that the film just kind of shrugs it off like a coat it thought it should wear because that's what all the other gritty urban crime dramas are wearing these days
Whether you buy Travolta in this role or not the film turns convoluted under the weight of too many subplots
I'm speaking as a notorious aficionado of bad John Travolta movies when I say The Forger is a chore to sit through
A slow movie that never really takes off and never shows its true intentions Full review in Spanish
You can't really make sense of all the subplots the only good thing about this is the performances of the main cast and even they struggle with the bad script Full review in Spanish
An average and forgettable story that doesn't add anything new to the genre Full review in Spanish
Even though you see the actors struggling to save the film it goes down on the weight of a very poor and fake script Full review in Spanish
A safe bet for the weekend that takes a little dignity whenever Christopher Plummer appears on screen Full review in Spanish
The script is a mess and it feels like it's two different movies where one is interesting and the other one is a waste of time Full review in Spanish
Part of the family drama works but whatever strokes of genius it could have goes to second term and it ends up being boring What a waste of talent Full review in Spanish
The Forger is a moderately entertaining low-key combination heist film crime picture and family drama
If you make it through all this without falling asleep consider yourself the survivor
Survivor is a pretty lame and frankly boring thriller that piles on one messy plot twist onto another and has more  scare analogies than Rudy Giuliani when he's running for office
There's little to enjoy about this daft spy thriller beyond the sight of Pierce Brosnan looking vaguely like a Spanish pimp when he wears a pencil-thin moustache as a disguise
Oh how you'll laugh at the dialogue at the plot and - most of all - at Pierce Brosnan's moustache which is so hilarious it deserves a film of its own
If there's a thriller to be found in international travel regulations this is not it Makes a mockery of the unsung heroes it's meant to celebrate
It's a lumberingly dated kind of spy thriller convoluted without ever being intriguing - and an insufficient number of bangs for your buck
While there is little in the film that's repellent there's even less about Survivor that's memorable
While not quite bad enough to be so bad it's good Survivor provides lots of completely unintentional entertainment
It's all thoroughly ludicrous yet strangely watchable
Survivor is the kind of film that relies on characters doing everything in a needlessly complicated way
A by-the-numbers thriller
Good call by Emma Thompson who baled out at the eleventh-hour from this copper-bottomed terrorist-themed stinker If only the others had her foresight
Survivor is  minutes of rip-roaring action with heavyweight actors managing to paper over some of the glaring plot holes with their performances
Unusually gritty and grounded this terrorism thriller avoids the pitfalls of most overwrought action movies by creating characters and action situations that are unusually believable even if the plot itself feels badly undercooked
There's a reason you've probably never heard of it
Brosnan is out of place as a grizzled bad guy but then it's hard to blame him because he has nothing to play
Survivor thought it was a film with a deep purposeful message about the current state of immigration and counter-terrorism I almost feel sorry for it Almost
I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to laugh out loud at several points during the press screening of Survivor but at least I wasn't the only one
Reaching the end of this you'll feel like you survived something
Survivor is an absurd film that would have done better by not taking itself so seriously
Introduces one far-fetched idea and then frustratingly refuses to expand on it The premise suffocates the movie
All Relative requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief
Does Hollywood have so little to offer women that well-regarded actresses feel obliged to accept demeaning indies like this flatly unfunny morally vacant comedy
Imagine The Graduate as rewritten by a golden retriever and you'll have some inkling of the intelligence level in the rom-com All Relative
Dull dim-witted and with scenes that drag long past their appropriate endpoint All Relative is a pedestrian romantic comedy that wastes a good cast
It thinks it's being surprising but really it's merely weaving several male sex fantasies together and making nothing insightful out of the resulting story
Although the resulting tonal shifts between funny and serious aren't always executed as seamlessly as they might be Khoury deserves props for defying rom-com conventions more often than he succumbs to them
All Relative fails to engage because the emotional connection between all parties is weak to nonexistent
A misguided indie romantic comedy to watch with someone you hate
An affable yet forgettable romcom
Contains an excess of self-impressed quirkiness that serves no real purpose and goes nowhere
Steve Howey as a stoner-sage gay Hawaiian personal trainer almost makes this worth watching all by himself
As deadly as its funereal subject matter
The ensemble dramedy See You in Valhalla could be the death knell for dysfunctional family reunion movies It's that bad
It's material we've seen before and the few oddball stamps feel painfully forced It's not even good for a cry dammit At least these family dramas are usually good for a cry
The characters feel familiar and the scenarios are contrived in this low-budget drama
Deplorable ugly and mean
Fails at finding a balance between its crass jokes and serious subject matter
A serious misfire
Courteney Cox's directorial debut Just Before I Go is a Garden State retread in which filthy jokes gradually cede ground to sentimental slush
Cox must have seen something in this screenplay that encouraged her to film it but whatever that critical element was it's not apparent in the finished product
Courteney Cox's misbegotten project is a comedy-drama that to Cox's credit doesn't feel at all like a TV sitcom The former Friends star clearly wanted something special but sadly the result is  this
Lurches along a wobbly line between salacious comic nastiness and nauseating sentimentality
Anchored by a nicely understated performance by Seann William Scott Just Before I Go effectively juggles a wealth of genuine at times profound emotion with quite a bit of nutty-raunchy humor
Cox must have seen something in this screenplay that encouraged her to film it but whatever that critical element was it's not apparent in the finished product
At times it's hilarious but the tone changes so much that it becomes hard to keep up
Adam Sandler stars in a watchable movie so yes there's a miracle involved Sandler tamps down the moron act to play Max Simkin a Bronx cobbler with a magical stitching machine that enables him to transform into his customers by slipping on their shoes
An odd mix of broad comedy and quaint nostalgia this flailing attempt at crowd-pleasing comedy attracted a strong cast to thankless roles
The core story hook may be preposterous but what best resonates in The Cobbler are its human slice-of-life elements and the big-city blue-collar milieu in which it is set
This comedic drama's high concept results in something that is neither-here-nor-there
Sandler's predictably simplistic comic targets mesh awkwardly with his director's own sense of moral complication
A top-of-the-range supporting cast makes this grindingly dull experience almost bearable
Collapses amid its attempts to reshape a notionally sincere script to fit an A-list heel
What makes The Cobbler particularly wounding is that for once the premise needn't have necessarily resulted in such a washout
I just can't take this film seriously
It's difficult to believe this sentimental pudding is written and directed by Thomas McCarthy who was behind the genuinely touching The Station Agent and The Visitor and wrote the script for Pixar's Up
Sandler had an opportunity to explore ethnicity family and morality He botches the whole thing
Much play is made on sole and soul and Sandler looks depressed throughout Fine - let it be him for a change
Proves too high-concept for the indie sensibilities of writerdirector Thomas McCarthy
A strange departure into slapstick renders any genuine sentiment null and void and the balance between comedy and drama is just never properly gaged
The Cobbler is the rare movie so terrible that it's hard to figure out why it even exists why somebody didn't run in front of the speeding train of its production yelling Stop
The Cobbler is startlingly thin and naive especially in regard to the larger implications of its hero's actions
The problem with this movie like so many Sandler films is that it tries to be a heartwarming tale while at the same time being offensive
The quirky magic-realist conceit has great potential but co-writerdirector Tom McCarthy fails to bring it to a shine
Method Man is the easy standout proving to be the most memorable piece of a film that embraces its slightness to warm hearts and lets the rest come what may
Throughout the film's  minutes you will find yourself wondering whether this is a genuine black comedy a family comedy a dramedy a cheap-shot drama or possibly a melodramatic modern-day superhero story about being a good Samaritan
This over-the-top affair may be of some interest to those looking for late night schlock but for most it will mark a low point in Lopez's career
Probably the guiltiest pleasure yet of the new millennia this brims over with unintentional titters
One of the stupidest films ever made
Rob Cohen's half-baked erotic thriller plays like a misguided homage to Eighties video fare and to family-in-peril sagas like Unlawful Entry or Cape Fear
This is popcorn cinema at its absolute worst -- and I thoroughly enjoyed a disturbingly large amount of it Though not for the reasons the director probably intended
The Boy Next Door is an absolute scream Unfortunately it's not meant to be
Playing out like a gender-flipped Fatal Attraction with a dwindling IQ it's comfortably one of the worst films of  to-date functioning more as an accidental comedy than the steamy erotic thriller it's billed as
Solidly MOR fare that should be propping up Channel 's Friday night schedule sometime very soon
Our faith in intergenerational relationships is dangerously compromised
An unwanted throwback to the sort of film you'd stumble across in  late on a Friday night on Channel
If the gender roles were reversed the seduction scenes would be considered exploitative and creepy
It's a disjointed frenetic series of unfortunate events that isn't even fun to watch mockingly Your time is better spent fantasizing about one of the two onscreen leads
Lopez is playing it straight And so is the director Rob Cohen It's hard for the audience to have fun when the filmmakers stay straight-faced
A movie of bare chests his and orgasmic moans hers this is part psycho thriller part cautionary sex fantasy part Lifetime-level affirmation of the primacy of the traditional family and all testimony to the irresistibility of Jennifer Lopez
A wonky erotica-thriller where despite Lopez's efforts and one deft sequence many spine-tingling or libido-vibrating scenes instead slip scantily towards comedy or B-movieness while its sociopath's mentality gets way too  Glenn Close-y for comfort
This gender-switch on Fatal Attraction abandons logic early lunging from borderline soft-core porn to flailing over-the-top melodrama and unintentional self-parody well before the halfway point in its modest -minute running time
Lifetime-ready have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too crap about a victimized woman turned righteous avenger in the last five minutes
The Boy Next Door comes off more as an inadvertent comedy than the thriller it's supposed to be
Occasionally it veers into the so bad it's good category but that doesn't change the fact it's very very bad
This is a marvel of bad editing and if that fascinates you you might enjoy yourself otherwise I'd steer clear
So flimsily constructed that it resembles a middle-school play that's been hastily filmed on an antique camcorder
Accidental Love did not have a smooth production process and it shows in the stitched-together final product
Forget the title Accidental Release is more like it
Really awful Unwatchably awful As in Give it the Razzie now and be done with it awful
A health care crisis subversive screwball mashup of Hollywood and Occupy Wall St the Kristin Gore deliberate social satire comes off as a different inconvenient truth And all the critics bashing this movie who have no health insurance raise your hand
Accidental Love is an utter mess which is understandable given its troubled provenance It's also fascinating
It's not hard to see why Russell washed his hands of the unfinished cut it would've been better left as the mysterious movie we never saw than the half-baked one we're lumbered with now
The bastard offspring of a charmless romcom and a toothless political satire
The misplaced screwball energy is wearying
A smoking crater of a film  the end result has vital scenes missing no ending and performances that often don't make sense
Accidental Love fields a top-level cast in a low-level comedy that combines the peculiar subjects of a nail in the brain and pork-barrel Washington politics
If there are David O Russell completists out there this is something for them
For this kind of comedy to work absolute precision and relentless speed are essential Given the circumstances in which the was made it is little surprise that neither are achieved
Catherine Keener's Machiavellian senator is a comic standout otherwise the film is strained and messy - but bonkers enough to keep you watching
It's so irredeemably bad that even Alan Smithee wouldn't touch it
Unsurprisingly it's a mess
David O Russell has moved on as should we all
Following Russell's Oscar-and-Bafta-winning streak of The Fighter Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle the only awards ceremony Accidental Love is likely to sweep is the Razzies
It's an unmitigated disaster not even worth a spin as a curiosity piece
A bit more focused and this could be a something worth saving Instead it's a about as slipshod as its new title
The filmmakers play Catherine's disgustingly narcissistic sense of entitlement as endemic to the supposedly girl-next-door charms befitting the film's thoroughly normative gender politics
Katey Sagal as a reclusive folk-rock star and the still magical setting aren't enough to recommend this thinner-than-thin musical romance
Any film justifies its existence when it gives Katey Sagal a chance to sing
Another week another benign rock and roll romance
This is a movie that runs on magical thinking
Unfortunately Merson clutters her sometimes soulful sensitive story with too many formulaic contrivances to impede Catherine's personal and professional progress
Even by its genre's comfort-food standards this movie feels blandly circumscribed almost child-proofed as if any sharper reality or wit might be harmful to the intended audience
The film uses its setting as lazy shorthand for the nostalgia of lost childhood the virtues of independence and the spiritual purity of acoustic rock
Just like its lead character the film can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up
Listless romcom has flat characters drinking
Catherine's journey towards acknowledging she's no better than any of the people she silently screams at in frustrated rage becomes a pit of quicksand
Noisy indecipherable nonsense and floppy dismally uninteresting character drama
With a damp squib of a sequel under its belt the 'Taken' franchise grinds to an utterly underwhelming finale
There's something sluggishly formulaic about the rollout of smackdowns chase scenes and general mayhem involving wrecked cars And a plot point involving warm bagels is downright ludicrous
Taken  takes the franchise past the point of absurdity - purely for the sake of selling a third series installment
A movie that thinks the way to earn our knuckle-biting is to be as dull as hell for  minutes then send a giant shipping container hurtling along the interstate But you yawn through that too
Taken  isn't a good movie Against all logic it isn't a bad movie either Instead it's so casual and indifferent to itself it lapses into something altogether appalling
Forest Whitaker turns in one of his sleepiest performances no one else seems to be trying very hard either yet director Olivier Megaton delivers some good chases fist fights and shots of Neeson looking glum
If in the first  minutes of this dreck you can't spot at least three plot holes big enough to drive a monster truck through then you're probably on the phone
It is time for Mills to finally settle into a quiet retirement while Neeson moves on to better heretofore untaken in every sense action showcases
So blatantly lazy and outrageously stupid it somehow makes me like the first Taken a little bit less End this merciless tedium
He never discovers the real killers are returning director Olivier Megaton and producer-auteur Luc Besson who callously dispose of the sympathetic Lenore to create new motivation for their hero's lethal kinesthesia and for their own chaotic set pieces
Fool me once shame on you Fool me twice shame on me Fool me thrice and now you're just sequel-baiting
Taken  is easily the weakest of the three films Oh sure Neeson kicks some backside But this time the plotting is feeble and the action scenes are just barely acceptable
Everyone involved with this picture should be embarrassed and boy do they look it
There is no redeeming value to Taken  We don't get the satisfaction of a well-made action movie the pleasure of elaborate stunt work or the pure joy of watching Liam Neeson badass his way through a bunch of heavies
If the tagline It Ends Here is true then it's a poor finale but perhaps it's the right time it is taken off our screens
Thriller fans looking for a bit of brainless biff will lap it up
Taken  may be this movie's title but the only thing taken here will be your money if you decide to pay to see what is the worst film in this franchise
What a spectacular way to ruin a great character Full review in Spanish
Taken  isn't a bad time it's often laughable without veering totally into self-parody
This juvenile horror-comedy spoof is primarily if unintentionally a cautionary tale about the perils of allowing brahs to make movies
by the final act neither the jokes nor the plot of the film are working
Zombie movies are horror's low hanging fruit and zombie parodies the lowest of low hanging parodies Whatever its shortcomings hhy would anybody spend more than it cost to make this one
So deprived of laughs not to mention brains it makes Meet the Spartans and Vampires Suck look like Airplane or Hot Shots
A self-congratulatory collection of feeble meta-awareness just dopey enough for adolescents to mistake for clever comedy
It's a slop bucket of lazy writing and uninspired jokesIf you want to laugh at zombies seek out Zombieland instead
The actual parody parts and attempts to lampoon the specific movies and TV shows of The Walking Deceased don't work It's better when it just settles into a straight comedy
Homages to Shaun of the Dead The Walking Dead and  Days Later are quite defensible but indiscriminate nods to such throwaways as the  Zombie Strippers and the  Warm Bodies nudge the film toward Wayans brothers territory
Fittingly brainless parody but sadly lacking wit subtlety and humor it proudly carries the torch of such crimes against comedy like 'Disaster Movie' and 'Epic Movie'
A one-star rating is too high but it's the lowest we can give
Clunky missing engaging elements of franchise filmmaking that would make the viewer beg for a continuation What's here is a cluttered snooze that limps to a conclusion
A horror franchise isn't born
Jinn is certainly not lacking in audacity but its uneasy balance between inspired delirium and mundane genre dues-paying is its one bridge too far
A watchable if rather convoluted effort
As an attention-grabbing opening installment for what's obviously intended as an ongoing horror franchise Jinn fizzles
Most of the time this incoherent thriller resembles an overheated trailer for itself a glaringly rough assembly of ill-staged computer-generated action sequences and portentous moments
With its awful acting terrible dialogue and laughable special effects Jinn strains for the hapless genius of Ed Wood but ends up just another bad movie
A deeply dopey distinctly not-terrifying unintentionally hilarious supernatural thriller
Some of Bob Kurtzman's third act make-up effects are a small silver lining but unfortunately Jinn is a pretty laughable affair
Writer-director Ajmal Zaheer Ahmad serves up glossy visuals on the back of a limited budget However Jinn often feels like it's a showreel for his visual talents An admittedly uneven one at that
Heigl and Wilson do their best to salvage a sinking ship putting in fine performances that embrace ghoulishness director Anthony Burns eventually turns away from
The kind of blithely confident creatively impoverished dud that leaves you slightly stunned someone greenlit it the movie has the distinction of feeling like a bad idea from its very first frames
This dismal stab at a darkly comic thriller is hardly the vehicle to resuscitate its lead actress's bigscreen career but it's unlikely to do much for anyone else's either
A bit on the nose but Heigl hits the mark in a role that seems tailor made for her
Home Sweet Hell is a pleasantly unpleasant dark comedy one that gives new meaning to detached and subdivided in the mass production zone
A rancid comedy fueled by male entitlement and uxoricidal rage Home Sweet Hell is the cinematic equivalent of the guy who's so busy ranting and raving about how untrustworthy women are that he hasn't noticed everyone's backed away from him
Wilson is an engaging actor but he's stuck treading water in a movie with little action Heigl on the other hand seems bored and aloof She's playing against type but she's stiff and doesn't make a fun villain here
It's high time Katherine Heigl sent up her image as a controlling bitch in heels too bad her dark comic turn takes place in an otherwise dreadful misogynistic slog of a film
Some scenes march fearlessly into the darkest of dark comedy recesses while others are played quite broadly to let us know that we shouldn't take all this nastiness too seriously The latter half of that equation is deadly for dark comedies
Although the film appears to be aiming for pitch-black humor it's all so mirthless that the result is genuinely ugly
Home Sweet Hell musters too little wit and too few laughs to sustain this humorous autopsy of suburban life
Home Sweet Hell doesn't deserve a hearty recommendation but watching Heigl almost makes the movie worth watching on her own
While the oafish men come off poorly the treatment of women as nothing more than schemers and monstrous Martha Stewart clones seems woefully past its expiration date
If Katherine Heigl thought the unappetizing dark comedy Home Sweet Hell might somehow help her flagging film career she was greatly mistaken
best viewed in the comfort of your own home on late night cable
Questions start arising immediately Is it satire Is it black comedy What is this
Home Sweet Hell is nothing more or less than a toothless satire of suburban conformity that might have felt a little more dangerous six decades ago
Insipid black comedy about suburban materialism and murder
A noxious piece of crud
In the end Home Sweet Hell is neither an adequate black comedy nor a good slasher film It's just hellish There's nothing sweet about it
What happens when stunt coordinators direct
Given the state of Nicolas Cage's rsum it's faint praise to say this samurai tale is slightly better than most of his recent movies
It's all quite stale but never outright offensive
With its wackily propulsive blend of furious action cheesy dialogue and deliciously unhinged overacting Outcast is a so-bad-it's-good B-movie perfectly primed for a drunken Saturday night
A few impalings and one deposit in the Nicolas Kim Coppola Raising Arizona Savings Bank Of Immortal Monologues aren't enough to help this thing shake its case of the Mondays
Stunt man Nicholas Powell helms his directing debut showing little regard for characters or story
The film may be best remembered for costar Nicolas Cage's warrior coif perhaps his most unflattering movie hairdo yet - and that's saying a lot
If there's any fun to be found in this dark tale it's the rare scenes of Cage and Christensen trying to out-ham each other
Outcast feels sort of like a Chinese pseudo-historical soap opera that's been crashed by a couple of white dudes forcing everyone to speak English with vaguely British accents
The barnacle-encrusted plot which pits little Prince Zhao Bill Su Jiahang the rightful heir to the emperor's throne against his murderous older brother Shing Andy On is dumbed down to the studs
A China-set th-century action drama that cuts with the blatancy of a broadsword
The status of actor Nicolas Cage's career has now definitively shifted from its entertainingly eccentric phase into its genuinely befuddling and perhaps sad phase
In a more gently constructed actioner - that would actually take time and effort to build their Chinese characters -Cage's bonkers moments would be awfully distracting In Outcast they're the only moments with any verve
The movie's only attribute is that it's so bad it might benefit from a Mystery Science Theater -style drubbing
In other words been there done that And you'd be wise not to go through it again with Outcast
Outcast at least has the benefit of a crazy over-the-top Cage performance that gives this horrendous film a few hilarious moments
It's so bad even Cage completists will struggle to reach the end Abysmal
For an action movie Outcast is really boring
Slick relentlessly upbeat propaganda that suffers from too many sins of omission
Meet the Mormons isn't substantial enough to screen on the first day of LDS  the church's most basic tenets - and controversial aspects - are elided completely
Would you go out of your way to see an infomercial that was more than an hour long Would you even pay for the privilege That's what Meet the Mormons would have filmgoers do
The narration promises surprises This story may challenge what you think you know about the roles men and women play in Mormon homes but the movie might have started by examining its straw-man conception of the audience
The film operates under the assumption that the average Joe associates Mormonism more with Sister Wives than Mitt Romney so the film will be an eye-opener only for subscribers to such stereotypes
Breaks the shocking news that LDS members 'come in all sizes shapes and colors' and 'love God and believe he has a plan for all of us Is this news worth  a ticket
Nearly nothing in Blair Treu's kindly public relations film illuminates the practices or beliefs of the church except for a will to goodness and success and small seemingly telling details go unremarked
There's nothing in the movie about Mormon history and no discussion of the unique aspects of LDS doctrine about which non-Mormons tend to be the most curious
Isn't it silly to demand the film be more than what the filmmakers intended it to be Did anyone expect the church to hire Michael Moore to direct its film
Nothing more than a slick-looking TV ad where its placement behind the pay wall of your local AMC Regal or Cinemark seems rather silly
Seriously if a movie ever deserved a Buyer Beware rating it's Vice-the mash-up of Westworld and Blade Runner that nobody wanted or needed
Here's hoping Bruce Willis bought something special with whatever cash he earned from this pointless brutally ugly rehash of 's Westworld
Low-budget and devoid of imagination Vice seems less like a proper film than a bargain-basement SyFy pilot shot cheap and drafting off Willis and Jane's star power
Dull and lifeless Vice fails to deliver on the promise of even its lowest ambitions
It doesn't even qualify for the dubious distinction of being so bad it's good
Evidencing more bullets than brains Vice - a bit of ephemeral science-fiction twaddle directed by Brian A Miller - has absolutely nothing to recommend it
It's one of those nearly straight-to-VOD pieces that fluctuates between boring and offensive never rising above either adjective
Recombining elements of Blade Runner Strange Days and AI makes Bruce Willis' Vice an intriguing sci-fi thriller but in the end it doesn't do enough with its ideas
Yet another muddle of clichs from the director who seems determined to turn everything he touches into a blue-tinted firestorm of shoot-outs chases and unenthused performances
Besides being morally questionable the movie is poorly made
Vice is Blade Runner on the cheap and minus the imagination
Bruce Willis plays the CEO of a futuristic resort where perfectly human-looking androids exist to fulfill their clients' deepest darkest desires - none of which it can safely be said involve watching movies as relentlessly mediocre as this one
The screenplay tries to mask its massive logical gaps with a string of tired action sequences
With gratuitous weak one-liners and a plot straight out of a How to Write A Screenplay In  Days seminar Vice has little going for it from the outset
Wavers between absurd and predictable while appropriating themes and ideas from a half-dozen better sci-fi flicks
Low-rent and wasteful of some intriguing ideas
It is set in as Bruce Willis' mogul character describes it a utopian paradise where you can have and do anything you want Unless that is you want a decent movie
Bruce Willis sleepwalks through this terrible science fiction film that's short on science but long on mindless gunfire
Even with Willis - who looks like he was only needed for a day's filming - phoning it in in every conceivable way it still manages to be a hell of a lot of fun
The acting ranges from amateurish Childers to bored Willis smirk barely disguising his lack of interest the script gets bogged down in lumpy exposition and the action is unexciting
It's not ironic amusing or clever
One of the most obnoxious horror pictures in recent years a low-rent cinematic charade that goes beyond spoofery and into a realm of distasteful tacky IQ-shrinking tedium
If they handed out awards for misogyny Muck would win effortlessly Most horror movies are a bit sexist It comes with the territory But this is simply the undressing and mutilation of women
The gonzo assault becomes an uneven straddle of Evil Dead camp and rote splatter leaving Muck to hobble along disjointedly like Jamie Lee Curtis' battered heroine as she tries to escape Michael Myers in Halloween
Muck isn't a horror movie - it's a wannabe skinflick that would ignore an on-screen kill if the actress' breasts were jiggling in the slightest Because bewbz
The plot is as scant and demeaning as the costumes
The themes are dealt with rather hastily however The martial arts action also feels a little truncated But it's the central relationship the intense transforming romantic encounter between warrior and witch that is the least successful element
With an incomprehensible plot and boring fight scenes there's not much to recommend when it comes to The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom
a kitsch-fu confection with its overblown sentimentalism matched only by its tacky day-glo backgrounds The action choreography however is imaginative and excellent
With lame action dull storytelling and a cast that look like they simply don't care it's sub-par style over non-existent substance as The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom laboriously plods through its  minute running-time
The performances are stiff and uninspired the storyline is trite the awkward special effects stand out like a sore thumb and everything is just so elongated that a couple of decent action scenes won't save an hour and a half of complete boredom
White Haired Witch is plagued with a copious cast and an overly complex storyline Keeping track of everyone is difficult and the screenplay is laughably bad in spots making it even less palatable
Dying of the Light is a shrill and bombastic slog with an all-over-the-map collection of tones that never cohere into a credible or compelling vision
The Dying of the Light isn't so much a massacred film as a dismembered one What's missing in the theatrical cut like the missing piece of Lake's ear is something that might pass unnoticed by many but which nevertheless leaves a hole
Trimmed within an inch of its life to  minutes Dying Of The Light is left with nothing but the faintest echoes of whatever ideas might have inspired its making
Despite all the glaring issues there's a handful of moments that show signs of life and of a superior film
Maybe Schrader's preferred version wouldn't have been a better movie but at least it might have matched the oddball intensity of its lead performance
After the wretchedness of Schrader's last picture 's The Canyons it surprises me that anyone would want to see what the helmer originally had in mind for this terrorist thrillermeditation on mortality
Schrader's direction alternatively often gives in to the standard-issue cop-movie nature of his screenplay
What remains isn't exactly terrible but it's also not particularly sharp or fresh and not really worthy of a filmmaker of Schrader's reputation
Something's amiss in the folds of punchy dialogue and a spy-filled plot
What is ultimately being released reeks of the studio's contempt towards modern audiences
There are some great ideas here and the film as a whole does make for cheerfully compulsive viewing
In recent years Paul Schrader has reached the unenviable position where his career has become at least as horribly compelling as the movies that he makes
What remains is by no means catastrophic just solemn and inconclusive with the darker psychological resonances Cage's character faces encroaching dementia lost in a rather woolly mix
A pedestrian globe-trotting cloak-and-dagger yarn that was reportedly butchered in post-production and which contains only intermittent flashes of the more interesting film that might have been
While this was all no doubt galling for Schrader and Kosuth you don't get the sense that there is a masterpiece lurking somewhere underneath
The plotting doesn't make much sense but Cage gives a typically flamboyant and uneven performance as the stubborn old agent
Nicolas Cage wigs out again as an unhinged CIA agent in this espionage thriller but this time it's his ragged prosthetic ear rather than his hairpiece that grabs the viewer's attention
despite all the formulaic flaws and re-workings of Schrader's original artistic vision Cage steals the show
Not much good to say except Cage Cage against the dying of the light Apologies to Dylan Thomas
It's a film full of Cage at his wide-eyed extreme intensity but many of the scenes seem to lose the process that made them
If one squints hard enough all the nudity and grinding might retain appeal but for those who can't switch their brain off the picture is maddeningly inconsistent and comically performed
Far be it from me to totally trash a seemingly-silly soap opera males might find laughable to the same extent it moves females to tears Go figure
While the leads are certainly attractive enough to bring the book to life the film fails to live up to the melodrama and seductiveness that made the book popular
The film lingers so lovingly over Zoe's many sexual exploits that one almost feels disappointed when it becomes clear that the film is about to turn into a lecture Erotica is best when it doesn't take itself too seriously
Addicted doesn't fail because it wants to provide steamy soapy melodrama to a mainstream audience its faults are a function of its judgment not of its genre  more Cinemax than cinematic
Billed as an erotic thriller but playing more like an R-rated daytime soap Addicted marks a rare but dramatically neutered opportunity to explore a black woman's sexuality onscreen
Addicted doesn't know whether it wants to be a modern-day bodice-ripper a morality-tinged cautionary tale or a serious snapshot of sexual compulsion Whatever the case it fails on all fronts
The film unfortunately depicts black female sexuality a topic rarely portrayed onscreen with all the depth and subtlety of a late night Cinemax offering
Watching Addicted is like eating Cheese Whiz straight from the jar There's no nutritional value It's kind of embarrassing But it does satisfy a base craving for cheap immediate sensation
Part soapy melodrama part steamy thriller of infidelity gone sideways this film is wholly unconvincing as a study of sexual compulsion
The actors are uniformly handsome and mostly serviceable though the same can't be said about the filmmaking or the writing
Woodruff's direction is smooth enough on a technical level but the film's storytelling has little dimension even for a melodrama
Addicted is the kind of film for which the Alan Smithee pseudonym was invented
There's nary a chill or shock cut in the film that isn't grafted from some other relatively recent fright flick and while the cast is uniformly game for the barely-there storyline they're also as generically high school as you might imagine
Nothing says Halloween more than gathering in the dark to experience a carefully strategised branding opportunity
The age-old seance question Is anybody there can be equally aimed at those behind the camera
A fairly generic teen horror flick
Tis the season to watch nubile teens get chased and bumped off by a Rentaghost reject
No great shakes
On the level of a fairground ride the film delivers but when it comes to such matters as emotion character development and suspense it's a bust
The bumps and thumps are mechanical the young stars insipid and the otherworldly entity the kids contact is called Doris
A mostly silly slab of horror with a cast of beautifully groomed American youths which makes it look strikingly like High School Musical only with screaming
Feature-length toy commercials may not get much more crass You can buy one of these at your local toy store one character literally snorts at one point
It's not scary or interesting the make-up and effects are subpar and the dialogue is ridiculous
More interesting than the movie is its motivation Does Hasbro really consider it smart marketing to make a film that suggests that playing with their Ouija game is likely to kill you and all your friends
There's nary a whiff of interesting individuality to any of the spirit-haunted teens here Scares are heavily stage-managed 'Ouija' must rhyme with 'squeegee' because you'll want to scrub your mind clean of this splatting damn spot of a flick
Like the source material it comes right off the assembly line
Ouija is a low grade low impact Final Destination-style horror rip-off
There's simply nothing scary about watching scenes that you've already seen play out in dozens of other better movies It gets boring Almost as boring as playing an actual game of Ouija
Ouija is one of those low-octane horror flicks you watch once and forget
The fun but predictable nature of Ouija will have you laughing in places where it probably wasn't intended
A supernatural horror brought to you by Michael Bay and Hasbro and released just in time for Halloween proves just as soulless as you might imagine it to be
The cinematic equivalent of a sleeping pill
Weepy Nicholas Sparks melodrama is cliche-ridden violent
I never thought a movie would make me long for the gritty realism of 'The Notebook'
The Best of Me will likely play well with its intended audience who know to bring a travel-size pack of tissues to the theater But thanks to its ending this doesn't rank among the better Nicholas Sparks adaptations like The Notebook
The worst Nicholas Sparks film of the nine based on his novels this is the epitome of disingenuous manufactured and manipulative The salt on the wound of an already bleeding heart is that the young adults outshine our artificial A-list lovebirds
The Best of Me is quite possibly the worst Nicholas Sparks adaptation ever committed to film
The film is a huge letdown due to the script The third act is so much a nonsensical head scratcher that it takes away the alluring romance fans wanted to walk away with
Like a hack tunesmith that keeps rewriting the same melodies over and over again hoping his legion of fans don't notice the ruse we've heard this Sparks song before
You can sneer but I don't care - the heart wants what it will and my heart wants Sparks So there
Me didn't have to be classy but remaining human would've been nice
Welcome the latest Nicholas Sparks adaptation always the same always a bit different but mostly the same
Dawson is called a white trash piece of poo by his own daddy which is rich because daddy -- a low-rent bayou criminal with a mean dog on a chain a shanty tramp on his lap and jet-black dye on his hair -- actually is a white trash piece of poo
The Best Of Me like all Sparks' work would rather kill his characters and leave a beautiful corpse than have them continue a real scarred relationship
Grab a tissue and get ready to have your heartstrings tugged in this Nicholas Sparks melodrama replete with its elements of love and lossThe perfect date movie the film is romantic in the purest sense
A rather typical Nicholas Sparks adaptation
There's something heavy-handed even for Sparks in the telling of the couple's story particularly when it comes to Dawson's family they are leering brutal embodiments of evil who function as handy plot devices
This film could be a real tearjerker for Sparks fans everyone else may find it tough to stomach
The Best of Me turns into a half-baked dramatic thriller with violent confrontations gunfights plenty of nasty characters and one big scary action scene
I would be amazed to hear even the most ardent Sparks fan defend it as anything more than rubbish
The Best of Me's chemistry lives in the idea of a second chance at first love - would you take it if you could - but not between the actors unfortunately
You know what to expect a star-crossed romance for lovers from different worlds kisses in the rain moonlight swims fateful separations and the tragic death of at least one leading character
There is just about enough narrative to hold interest while the lyrical camerawork constantly in motion blurred images and all offers a single emotion that is impossible to stretch over a feature-length film
The most pertinent take away from Tar is simply how influential the Terrence Malick aesthetic has become A fascinating failure it works better as a class experiment than as a watchable piece of cinema
If The Tree of Life was a contemplation of the universal mysteries and verities of life The Color of Time is an hour spent scrolling through a stranger's family album
Some of the fault lies with the film's  directors whose polished washed-out visually consistent contributions aren't separated into individual chapters but pieced together into an atmospheric whole
Pretty and pretty derivative
Another in a growing line of pretentious James Franco disasters nobody will ever see
Despite the ambition on display the film feels awfully slight like a dream forgotten immediately upon waking
The uniformity of its languorous lens-flared visuals may wear on all but the most ardent Terrence Malick devotees many of whom I suspect are also grad students
Franco makes a lot of art both good and bad But no one provides a bolder example of the vanishing lines that used to separate movie stars fringe artists and working actors
You couldn't possibly find a more James Franco project produced by and starring James Franco than The Color of Time even if you tried
The Color of Time for all the experimentalism of its conception falls some way short here and ends up an irreproachably tasteful easily digestible but an unsurprising undemanding watch
A cool concept and A for effort
The film is too sincere an expression of admiration for this poet's work to feel pretentious but it's like a music video for the poems often literal in its biographical readings
The Color of Time is an odd bird in that its  cooks don't necessarily spoil the broth The problem is that they leave it as broth
Based on Pulitzer Prize-winning poet CK Williams's autobiographical work The Color of Time is about poetry though it has none to speak of
Probably should have stayed in the classroom
The Color of Time serves as a reminder that literalizing and adapting poetry for the screen is usually not a good idea
This dreamlike film directed by twelve graduate students from New York University fails to make celebrated American poet CK Williams much more than a mildly interesting daydream Despite its top acting talent it even inspires a deeper sleep
The idea of students collaborating with a stable of famous actors is a wonderful story in itself but to then treat the culmination of the exercise as more than a student thesis film does it a disservice
A Chekhov modernizationadaptation that doesn't quite come off despite a generally accomplished cast
At  minutes Days and Nights feels choppy and hurried pushing the narrative toward inevitable tragedy rather than exploring how these dispirited people got there
Camargo maintains an odd relationship with the source material his script lost in the limbo between 'inspired by' and 'adapted from'
One can certainly give this movie A for effort but the achievement falls far short of the lofty intentions
In a movie nothing good ever seems to happen at a country house And when it comes to this film nothing very interesting happens either
The cast so packed with talent that Jean Reno and Cherry Jones barely register is stuck with stagey dialogue Juliet Rylance in the Nina part has a particularly hard time
The drama over dinner comes in small analgesic portions and the secrets feel canned and the dialogue is too pretty to be believable
This god-awful reimagining of a Chekhov masterpiece will only have you yearning to see Sidney Lumet's underrated  version
Those who are familiar with the comedic drama are likely to find Camargo's ideas interesting if a bit obligatory while those who have neither read nor seen The Seagull may just come away thinking of it as a pretentious art film
It's difficult to invest emotionally in these lugubrious characters and their various avenues of depression and dysfunction
Lines are read as if unrelated to the ones that came before it giving conversations a stilted unnatural coldness
A generic plodding story
Like Better Luck Tomorrow it tries to cut cool-movie poses under the pretense of providing an alternative racial viewpoint to typical genre tropes
Green Dragons wants to be spaghetti with marinara but it's closer to egg noodles and ketchup
Revenge of the Green Dragons is an engaging and ruthless tale about the cycle of violence
A generic nondescript gangster saga
Revenge Of The Green Dragons sorely misses a true story backbone that's removed in favor of flashy synthetic action And even those moments foolishly go up in smoke
An undercooked crime-drama that feels like a pale imitation of the movies that clearly inspired it
What initially feels like brash energy peters out until what's left mainly evokes pretty ordinary gangster movies
This crime drama wants to be a Chinese-American Goodfellas but it ends up just looking bad
What made Martin Scorsese attach his name to this rubbish
Loo and Lau have borrowed so liberally from sources like GoodFellas that they're essentially dressing it in one-size-fits-all gangster-movie clothes
An ugly dispiriting mess full of clichs bad taste and bombast
Vicious 's gangs fight in graphically violent drama
This crudely made thriller plays like a stilted Cantonese riff on organized-crime cliches substituting blood and brutality for novelty or insight
There's a good story somewhere in Revenge of the Green Dragons but it's not the one Lau and his colleagues chose to retell
Violent generic not awful but nothing more than that
It doesn't bring anything new to the table And its pacing grim tone and cheesy guitar riffs belong squarely in the 's
The representation of Asian American men as hot-blooded toughies in the film does put a dent in the omnipresent nerdy eunuch stereotype and the model-minority myth
The self-inflating tale of two immigrant brothers who join a Chinatown gang as kids falls woefully short of significance despite being executive produced by Martin Scorsese
Revenge boasts Martin Scorsese as an executive producer and it really does boast - Scorsese's is the first name we see but the clich-ridden narrative and patchy acting prevent the film from being Chinatown's answer to Goodfellas
In real life Elvis had a stillborn twin What if he'd lived A fictional look at the possibility is more interesting as a sentence and a brief thought than a movie
There's a whole lot of Bible-banging in this film produced by the faith-based City of Peace Films and while one wants to remain as open-minded as possible about it the results are pretty dire
Packed with parts that shouldn't go together and don't go together but which when put together anyway create the kind of experience you partake with jaw dropped and brows furrowed
Imagine if Tommy Wiseau from the The Room was an evangelical Christian Elvis impersonator who made a royalty-free biopic starring himself as twins Hell yes you should see this probably twice
It's stocked with clichs but they're arranged in such weird ways that the end result is both predictable and certifiable If only any of it actually went somewhere
Where is all this going you ask Good question
Rock fantasies are rarely this milquetoast
Long a subject of fascination for certain Elvis fans and scholars of American popular culture the connection between the King of Rock and Roll and the King of Kings finds its most elaborate expression yet in 'The Identical'
Musical melodrama lacks charisma but is fine for tweens
a bizarre musical drama that laughably tries to pass itself off as an inspirational faith-based tale of wish fulfillment
A hollow inspirational Christian-themed jukebox musical that is flat out absurd
To paraphrase a Presley classic Wise men say only fools rush in to see a one-trick pony revolving around an annoying Elvis look-a-like
Even with all the faith injected into this film like a wino mainlining heroin there's no real message no real conclusion and no real resolution
It's a mysterious hilarious mess a confusional cry for directions in a Triple Elvis Universe Buy your ticket now before it magically disappears from theaters and feel the brain-breaking power of song
A what if about Elvis' twin provides good entertainment for those seeking family fun and for die hard Elvis fans
Did you know that Elvis had an identical twin brother named Schmelvis
Fans of bad movies please note This is a must-see This is so bad it must be seen to be believed - 'Showgirls' bad a vision that slowly goes wrong then terribly wrong then hits disaster levels In a sense it's an Ed Wood-ian exercise in wrong
Heartfelt Story  Loved the Music
This is a terrific premise for a movie Too bad they do so little with it
While it's not a dull time working within a fictional construct it lacks the depth to really make this come alive
Aside from some inspired uses of chiaroscuro lighting the movie around Depardieu is mostly derivative
In a way the occasionally lugubrious undertones and casual cruelties suit the setting but the tragic heft Mr Martinez seems to be pushing for doesn't materialize
Viktor is such a hackneyed jumble it could put an end to avenging-dads thrillers as we know them That is if anyone were to take it seriously
Wow Viktor is stunningly bad
Depardieu lumbers through the film looking as though he's tormented by indigestion rather than a lust for vengeance
This wannabe-elegant crime drama has the stench of a script Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington threw out an airplane window
Both the cheapest-looking and most narratively deficient film in the series a rather pathetic end to a project undertaken with more ambition than talent
We get it we get it Capitalism is good government is bad But Atlas Shrugged Who Is John Galt is worse
To find fault with the Atlas Shrugged franchise because of its politics is like complaining about Birdemic because it gets the ornithology wrong Why dwell on the details when there are giant embarrassing flaws staring you in the face
A missed opportunity to speak to anyone other than the converted but at least as the culmination of its makers' will
Rand's parable is meant to showcase just how much our world needs the best of us but this adaptation only does so accidentally -- by revealing what movies would be like if none of the best of us worked on them
The prior installments weren't very good movies and it should surprise few that this last one is the worst of the lot
The favorite book of many young sociopaths you meet in business schools it's all about a bunch of rich crybabies who don't want to share their toys so they break them and go home
With virtually nothing that happens onscreen resembling human behavior or emotion to any real extend the film can't even function as propaganda
In  when Warner Bros filmed The Fountainhead Rand threatened to burn down the studio if they compromised her novel I'd like to think that if she were alive she'd be looking for lighter fluid for this one
Prime Mystery Science Theater  fodder cut-rate to the point of incoherence
Not only did the twist they had been endlessly hyping come across as a limp afterthought but the movie itself is a gruelingly unpleasant slog No Good Deed deserves to be punished
The suits at Screen Gems had the right idea They just failed to carry it through Their mistake wasn't scrapping the picture's press screenings It was failing to scrap them all
There's no good brain in No Good Deed
There should be something more exhilarating about the violent and hopeful epilogue finale than there is
begins as a not incompetent home-invasion thriller and ends with a nifty punch line about female empowerment The problem is everything in between
No Good Deed slouches toward its inevitable conclusion much like that rough beast to Bethlehem falling apart and lacking all conviction
A cunningly calculated pulp thriller that coincidentally arrives at a moment when outrage over violence against women has become impossible for even the NFL to ignore
No Good Deed promises little but to its credit it largely lives up to that promise You don't need to lower your expectations for the film it lowers them for you roundly but quietly apologizing at every turn for not being better than it is
There's nothing to distinguish TV director Sam Miller's pedestrian effort from scores of straight-to-download thrillers
Sometimes you fancy the finest caviar known to humanity Other times you fancy some greasy fish and chips No Good Deed belongs in the latter category
Elba and Henson both produced this crazily overwrought stranger-danger B-movie so they're getting no free passes here
Elba gives good psycho smoulder and Henson occasionally gets to flex her acting muscles and break out of the damsel-in-distress clichs when she's fighting back against this conflicted home invader yet neither can overcome the script's limitations
This clunkingly terrible film is a baffling career move for Elba and a waste of co-star Taraji P Henson
A routine thriller
The plot stumbles lazily from one thriller trope to the next and while it does provide some jumps is predictable to the point where you can call the action before it happens
Not content with painting Idris Elba's escaped convict Colin as a thoroughly bad sort the suspense-free home invasion movie No Good Deed has a score that assaults us with histrionic crashes and bangs
It is dismaying to see the brilliant Idris Elba and Sam Miller his director from TV's Luther working on low-grade exploitation fare like this
There's a few table-turning twists that lend a veneer of final-girl sister-power  but little else to provide big-screen distraction
No Good Deed is one of the least inspired and laziest films of  featuring a complete lack of originality and a waste of talent from Idris Elba and Taraji P Henson
No Good Deed made some decent box office and didn't cost much to make Perhaps there'll be a sequel Good Samaritan Goes Bad or Call Triple-A Cause I Ain't Opening the Door
it's a much better film many times over than the  version with Kirk Cameronwhich is to say it's still a slightly below-average movie
The heavy-handed sermonizing tends to compromise most of the suspense and the overwrought climax is both ridiculous and unintentionally hilarious
Left Behind is a generic plane crash into oblivion with Nicolas Cage at the wheel that attempts to shove its heartwarming ideals down your throat
the most boring version of the Rapture I could have ever imagined
It's bad alright but not so bad it's good It's just so bad it's bad And that's too bad
Left Behind isn't a movie for progressive Christians any more than it's a movie for people who appreciate top production values convincing acting or superlative dialogue
I can't wait for Nic Cage to explain THIS one to God on Judgment Day
Left Behind is being marketed as Christian entertainment but it does not qualify in either category
may be one of the most inept films to ever see a wide theatrical release
Unfortunately even after the rapture starts Left Behind never picks up steam
The movie unravels in its own destruction Every effort to milk the tragedy of the apocalypse is met with terrible music acting and effects that soak and drown the pathos in camp fare
Faith-driven audiences deserve better
I am now relatively certain there is a Hell and it is a darkened theater with no doors showing Left Behind on a loop for eternity
The first movie made from this material was all about the Anti-Christ taking over the UN This one's about landing a plane
A very circumscribed boring thriller that director Vic Armstrong hobbles with a very quiet non-urgent tone throughout
My goodness what on earth is Nicolas Cage doing in this movie
Outlandishly inept in every way 'Left Behind' is easily one of the worst movies of
I never thought I'd write this but Kirk Cameron's Left Behind flawed as it is looks and sounds better in almost every single way
Ostensibly an exploration of biblical themes Left Behind avoids any theological debate to revel unsuccessfully in the mass-hysteria created by God's Rapture
The only prayers Left Behind inspires are for Nicolas Cage's career
The Damned does all it can to make witches scary once again but flashes of inept acting and tonal fumbles spoil what could have been a horrifying feast of riches
There's little to dig into once formula takes over leaving the effort predictable Shrieking and bloody but predictable
From its first draw of blood onward it bolts down a foreseeable slasher-movie trajectory laying on thick the dramatic irony while constantly inventing new reasons to punish its characters for old iniquities
It's all well acted and expertly crafted - quick edits that play mind and visual games with the viewer music that heightens tension some cool special effects - but most of the victims are people you want to slap even before their secrets are spilled
The film looks good and overall production quality is certainly serviceable but at the end of the day The Damned is just another of countless horror films
Director Victor Garcia and screenwriter Richard D'Ovidio really just want to get down to business so they don't waste much effort on plot
A crummy shocker
A tepid horror movie that runs out of ideas long before it runs out of victims
The Damned could find a niche as part of a Halloween possess-a-thon but on its own there's just not much to it
A horror film that has few scares brings nothing new to the genre and you'll forget as soon as you leave the theatre Full review in Spanish
The movie starts just fine but as it progresses it slowly turns into an involuntary comedy Full review in Spanish
A tone-deaf everything-is-connected melodrama
Somehow this thin script attracted that star sprinkled cast
Herzfeld appears to have a worldview more formed by bad movies and TV shows than by any experience of day-to-day life as a human being on Earth
In the  annals of throwaway flops save a special place for  wasted minutes of drivel called Reach Me
The excessive plotlines are sloppily written and choppily edited while the acting is almost uniformly subpar Worse the concept itself is bafflingly empty
Plays like an amateur-acting exercise in which each participant picks a name and a couple of defining props
A misbegotten venture that constantly ups its own ante on histrionic overacting ludicrous plot twists and insipid empowerment mantras
The score works overtime to assert what kind of movie this is sometimes shifting several times within a single scene Choices include a low-rent thriller a contemplative drama and a slick Elmore Leonard-style crime farce None of them stick
The characters keep bumping into one another like a cut-rate Crash only to drift apart until the plot needs another twist
Casting Sylvester Stallone as a gossip-site publisher obviously modeled on Matt Drudge is one of many counterintuitive ideas that backfire in Reach Me
A kitchen-sink mess with no discernible narrative drive or thematic resonance beyond uninspired batches of bad behavior gunplay eccentricity and weak uplift
'Reach Me' is the sort of movie where careers go to die
Once you've sunk into the entirely warped groove of Reach Me you're almost eager to experience the next offense against aesthetics andor common sense it is poised to commit
A toneless mess that's more chaotic than soul-searching more irritating than meditative
Nothing in the proceedings is remotely convincing let alone entertaining
Reach Me takes a long list of cliches -- some more offensive than others -- and mixes them all together with a fancy cast to make a boring pretentious film Reach for an actual book instead
At times Reach Me is undeniably intriguing mostly because it's just so weird and disconnected Eventually though it just becomes tiresome
Reach Me feels lazy in desperate need of its own motivational speech
Herzfeld is determined to make these puzzle pieces fit yet there isn't much to solve with Reach Me which gradually limps to a cop-out close
The jokes aren't funny and the earnest stabs at emotional sincerity ring false in this ensemble melodrama
Lost in this barely coherent and clichd hugger-mugger is the initial killer-website conceit and the attending erotic dread which is retrospectively revealed to be an illusory siren call
If CamCam was a Chatroulette user you'd pass by this cyber snoozer without hesitation Next
Its supposedly percipient musings on modern love clash with the unshakeable feeling that the film feels like a relic unearthed from a high-school hard drive
Somehow CamCam directed by Joel Soisson falls spectacularly short for the genres it hopes to pander in slasher pic soft-core travelogue
A sloppy chiller about tourists falling prey to an online stalker in Bangkok that clumsily mixes slasher sexploitation and supernatural elements
If the first twenty minutes hooked me the next twenty had me checking out
The meta-narrative leanings of Ryan Phillippe's directorial debut almost predictably give way to self-congratulation
Timely reasonably tense exploitation thriller that is a tad too obvious and safe with its commentary on celebrity culture social media and bayou bumpkins
Catch Hell suffers from both a drowsy start and a dragging ending
Catch Hell wastes a generic hostage story on cartoonish characters who redefine what we deem to be stereotypical
This is Phillippe's feature-length directorial debut and the suspense isn't well orchestrated
The teenage assassin thing has become a tired cliche whose creators unconvincingly cite female empowerment to defend this tackiest of fetishes
Worse than any Uwe Boll movie Just terrible
Dabbling in the same fetish-feminism and coldly-served revenge fantasies that made Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch such a wildly divisive workRalph Ziman brings an appropriately seedy but miserably downbeat aesthetic to this long-in-development adaptation
For anyone compiling a list of Samuel L Jackson's worst films you're in for a treat Kite will be hard to beat
If you're satisfied with pure bloody action Kite is the ticket If you want a little emotional and intellectual engagement try somewhere else
Bloodthirsty young women are no longer novel enough that this watered-down revenger can expect us to pay attention without bringing something new to the table
Every exterior is foggy to diminish how far we can see ie how far the production design could afford to make look like a rundown near future
In a film that pits the heroine directly against the sexualization of young women the camera's gaze itself feels awfully exploitative
Ziman pretends to be empowering his young heroine by putting a gun in her hand and tough words in her mouth But there's something deeply discomforting about his camera's fetishistic leering
It's impossible to get all worked up with a formulaic revenge story when the participants don't seem like they want to be here either
A kill-a-minute gore-a-thon whose twist is so obvious your grandma Edna will see it coming Kite never gets off the ground
Nasty for nastiness's sake Kite drags to achieve its brief running time you wonder whether the slow motion is an artistic device or a stalling tactic
Ziman struggles mightily to weave hot-girl assassin shtick trendy exploitation style and future-shock grimness The default setting seems to be whatever you've seen in a hundred other movies and heard - the electronic score is pure digital Muzak
Filled with light parkour terrible speed-ramping and frenetically edited combat Ziman's film could easily be repackaged as The Asylum's ripoff of Lucy
Reclaim's highly mechanized plot ensures that the film is over before it even ends
There are no twists or even surprises except the final realization that director Alan White is taking his culturally clueless ineptly shot B-movie totally seriously
A message before the closing credits cites the widespread incidence of child trafficking but any social import is lost This isn't activism it's by-the-numbers suspense
Carmine Gaeta and Luke Davies' screenplay is constructed from plot mechanics and the emotional stakes grow less convincing with every twist of the screw
Alan White's polished but pedestrian pic mines little real suspense and few surprises from a formulaic script
Once the sides are firmly established Reclaim dutifully goes through the subpar-thriller motions
In any movie where good people are being scammed by nefarious ripoff artists there's the potential moment where the protagonists become so stupid and trusting that you lose all sympathy for them That moment occurs about midway through Reclaim
Reclaim isn't a disaster it's just disappointing and thoughtless after a potent introduction
While we can all agree that human trafficking is a despicable thing it's also clear that this amazingly inept screenplay fails to do the issue justice
If you're not expecting too much Drive Hard is mindlessly entertaining but it lacks that spark of madness that might have made it truly fun
Scruffy low budget the driving is weak but in some weird way Jane and Cusack have chemistry and make this fitfully amusing
This movie is so colorless odorless and especially tasteless so devoid of mass or substance that it's easy to forget even while it's still playing
Just as egregious as its retrograde sexual politics however is the film's distinct lack of energy or wit -- shortcomings that ultimately render it merely a cruddy B-movie throwaway
Cusack and Jane look like they're improvising much of the time and while that doesn't lead to a better movie the off-the-cuff approach is the best thing in the film
Falls a little flat never quite secure in its insanity and perhaps a bit too ambitious with its screenplay which spends more time building secretive allegiances than it does tending to the visceral highlights
Essentially a chase movie infused with buddy comedy elements the film is a fast-paced mildly entertaining lark that's chiefly enlivened by Cusack's droll performance
It's dumb It's ugly And yet it's not all bad
It doesn't exactly work up a sweat devising an interesting plot villains but the badinage between the odd couple  makes the time pass painlessly enough
Feels like the work of a computer program that analyzed dozens of popular movies in different genres then self-generated a screenplay that tried to incorporate elements from all of them
Normally I would have no objection to being trapped in a car with John Cusack but that was before I saw Drive Hard
Approximately as unforgettable as its title
Does a lot of revving in order to juice its jokey violent bad-boy cred but it never gets out of the driveway
Sputtering on fumes almost from the start it captures a well-earned checkered flag as one of the worst films of
A deeply terrible would-be action comedy that looks sounds and feels like an s cheap and cheesy made-for-cable movie
You know there's something fundamentally wrong with Drive Hard less than five seconds in It opens on a shot of star Thomas Jane sporting an absurd mop of a hairdo that might have been borrowed from a Raggedy Ann doll
It's no fresher than its title - a long chase movie with Cusack as master thief and Thomas Jane as his reluctant accomplice
Drive Hard is just a bore barely registering as a movie which is a shame because with the oddball cast and somewhat notable director it could have been fun and trashy
Delivers a goodly amount of good natured action fun but in the end suffers from being just too low-key for its own good
Very disappointing potboiler that runs out of gas far too quickly
'Taken' without any of the charisma or energy
Macho mayhem as the male version of maternal instinct While Willis rather delicately negotiates his darker side in a shaky balance between a slightly humanized professional psychopath seeking closure for a major grievance and just a really rotten dude
An idle Netflix user could certainly do far worse when browsing for mindless actioners But the overall air of shrugging obligation from those both in front of and behind the camera proves contagious
Unless you're a fan of yawn-worthy shootouts and showdowns The Prince is a Taken retread hardly indicative of any special set of skills
This isn't a passion project for anyone involved It's a by-the-numbers affair that's landing on the right side of the ledger book It's about mercenaries on both sides of the camera
If filmmakers were put on trial for hackery a good prosecutor might ask director Miller why The Prince contains no discernible prince but does feature a closing-credit shout-out to Prince Yoohanhwesa
Aggressive but hopelessly thin The Prince hopes to dazzle viewers with famous faces which act as a rodeo clown while the rest of the picture trots out snoozy underworld and revenge clichs in a most uninspired script
The Prince is a royal dud
Originality either in terms of writing or direction in in short supply in this assembly-line vigilante thriller
Rick's ultimate journey becomes less about atonement than simply getting the girl and moral reclamation reveals itself as the vehicle by which to peddle a bunch of people behaving badly
A game supporting cast and a miscast leading man add up to a half-hearted randy teen farce
Aside from a few lines of juicy bad language Gomez plays the innocent in this fast-paced screwball farce which is full of cheerful vulgarity but dangerously low on wit charm or narrative logic
A misfiring misadventure not even recommended for diehard Selena Gomez fans
One of the worst pictures of  a tribute to Risky Business made by people who only read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box
Behaving Badly is  minutes in a search of a laugh each of them so punishing that viewers are left to spend most of the movie trying to figure out what went wrong
Selena Gomez is adorable and manages to float away unscathed But other than that it's an unfunny comedy populated by irredeemable sociopaths
A number of really talented people make appearances in the wretchedly unfunny teen sex comedy Behaving Badly so many that you wonder if a producer has incriminating photos stashed somewhere
For a comedy that so desperately wants to be rude and sexy this movie is remarkably timid It does a great job putting up a front as an anarchic laugh riot but the genuinely funny moments are few and far between
Raunchy high school comedy is a big disappointment
Behaving Badly is a contender for the worst film of the year
This ruthlessly unfunny misfire should be quickly relegated to an IMDb trivia question after a brief theatrical bow
An attempt at a modern noir that works its way to a pretty exciting if absurd climax but mostly bides time until then
Good People  thinks it's a lot smarter than it really is
Mindless and mechanical until it suddenly decides to abandon any pretense of sense in a pulpy third act that hints in the faintest fashion at the deranged fun the film could have been
Good People provides the degree of entertainment one expects while sitting on a sofa watching a direct-to-video effort rather than the higher standards one sets for paying  for a movie ticket
Feels like a half-hearted jumble full of lazy shortcuts
Weirdness is exactly what Good People needs providing something diverting to break relentless formula that dries out the excitement that has managed to survive the brutal editorial process
It's barely  minutes long but Genz manages to exhaust every cliche in the thriller genre But he's just talented enough to make it work
If it managed to at least be a consistently thrilling ride none of that would matter but intermittently good just isn't good enough
They might be good people but they make a bad movie in the case of this generic thriller
Despite a seasoned cast that ranges from James Franco to old reliable Tom Wilkinson this awkward fusion of Shallow Grave and Home Alone never amounts to a credible or compelling tale
A fairly standard white-people-in-peril thriller
Tom and Anna are so thinly sketched that by the time the painfully slow set-up starts to pay off we no longer care who does what to whom or why
For Franco completists only
What could have been a darker version of Home Alone may have saved the entire thing but the obvious lack of budget means it doesn't really go anywhere
There is little inspiration to be found and the end product is serviceable at best
The filmmakers use slick editing and pounding music in a desperate bid to paper over the cracks in their own storyline
This involving set-up soon gives way to tired gangster cliches culminating in a crude and over-the- top bloodbath
This increasingly ramshackle thriller somehow manages to bodge many of its key plot points leaving the narrative as badly maintained as the rundown houses it occupies
Genz piles on lots of tedious and increasingly silly plot turns involving shoot-outs in London and domestic fights involving nail-guns - all en route to a lame cop-out ending
This low-rent crime thriller's London setting never feels convincing and the film's action-packed climax which sees the couple fending off the bad 'uns using power tools is even more far-fetched
Dinesh D'Souza taps his Tea Party audience for more Obama-bashing cash before he goes to prison for trying to buy an election
D'Souza asks softball questions of those he agrees with What is your American dream he asks US Sen Ted Cruz and leading questions of others and his narration is peppered with generalities platitudes and truisms
The cinematic equivalent of one of those forwarded e-mails of mostly discredited facts that you receive from an uncle
Ironically in presenting the argument against Zinn and others by attacking what D'Souza terms indictments of America he takes a page directly out of the Zinn playbook AMERICA asks one very important question what's been left out of the history books
Throughout the film we see D'Souza walking through American landmarks gravely studying them deep in contemplation It brings to mind the old joke about the government Trust me I'm here to help
It's Sesame Street-style show and tell complete with highly suggestive musical cues
Hilariously just minutes after reducing Occupy Wall Street to an assault on small hamburger shops D'Souza attacks insurance companies and Wall Street executives as fellow travelers in Obamacare this country's one unpardonable sin
Graced with a hilariously definitive title America is astonishingly facile a film comprised entirely of straw man arguments
You could bother debating D'Souza on history and semantics and rudimentary logic but chances are you'd end up feeling like Meathead arguing with Archie Bunker
The ways D'Souza appropriates famous figures and misreads history slavery wasn't so bad because all civilizations did it he argues at one point are ludicrous
D'Souza has a gift for stating his opponent's position without actually addressing it
The actual problem with America is that it is structured poorly with a third act that seems tacked on even though that's where it finally gets to the point
This is an unusually odious effort because it is so hugely hypocritical and ultimately self-serving
Is Dinesh D'Souza stupid This seems like kind of faux-innocent question the far-right columnist and polemicist poses all the time But the answer honestly isn't clear
D'Souza's main problem here is that he has really made three films in one and he has failed to flesh out any of the three Full Content Listings for Parents also available
Highly charged docu has strongly conservative message
Divisive D'Souza Imagine an America without him
America would be simply annoying if it were just preaching to the choir what makes it unendurable is the fact that D'Souza and Sullivan can't craft a sermon that would keep even the choir awake interested and entertained
There's no doubt that D'Souza loves America but he loves it much in the same way that we all do According to a map of his own design
A heinously inflammatory propaganda piece that gives the documentary form and even-minded conservatives bad names America Imagine the World Without Her boils down to  minutes of uneducated ignorance
There's no attempt to convince us that the world is being corrupted by people who haven't accepted the Gospel it merely assumes we agree with that idea
The Lord works in mysterious ways but Persecuted works in blundering obvious ways straining a Christianity-under-attack theme through a dopey thriller
Miscast miscalculated And who is persecuting whom here
If Persecuted wasn't such a dire thriller its sweaty fear of pluralism might at least be amusing
The hero's allies pop up and disappear killers are on his heels then they aren't And that whole business about the Christian evangelical leader whose father is a Catholic priest Yeah that doesn't get explained either
Straw-man cinema doesn't get much more ludicrous than this heavy-handed Christian-themed minister-on-the-run thriller
Just why one particular TV preacher is so all-fired important isn't clear and neither is anything else about this overwrought mess
A heavy-handed and didactic drama which also manages to be totally mushy in terms of the message it's trying to convey
Persecuted squanders the talents of its impressive cast -- including James Remar Bruce Davison Fred Dalton Thompson and Dean Stockwell -- with its bizarre premise and inept execution
The movie's entire concept is fatally flawed
Lusko's leaden dialogue and heavy-handed symbolism is as unintentionally comical as the miscasting of Fox News host Gretchen Carlson as a journalist
Woe to the filmmakers of 'Persecuted'
Persecuted matches its conservative beliefs to an anachronistic narrative structure and dated cinematic execution
Have Wilson Galifianakis and Poehler ever been better Gosh I certainly hope so
Weiner has not set out to make anything as trite as a buddy comedy but he does attempt to inject humour and misses the mark
An endearing muddle which flails in search of an identity
Are You Here proves a gently immersive ingratiating often witty character comedy with a pair of comfortably effective lead performances
Are You Here doesn't feel all there
Are You Here lacks more than just the question mark that should go on its title It lacks a point-of-view that makes sense that feels central
Everything about Are You Here feels like a bottom-drawer script idea that was put together too casually and carelessly
Many a critic has said that there's nothing worse than an unfunny comedyand Are You Here proves that point over and over again
A comedy with no laughs A drama disconnected from any known reality
This is one of those semi-serious projects comedians occasionally step into wanting to stretch and winding up straining
It's funny clunky earnest and barely credible but it's all of a piece
Flawed friendship dramedy has plenty of drugs some sex
Surely the characters on Mad Men aren't as one-note as these otherwise a petition should be started to have Weiner's Emmys forcibly removed
Proof that genius doesn't always successfully translate from one medium to another
What does surprise is that the talented ensemble has to cajole this ungainly movie along even as it changes its mind about whether it wants to be a romantic comedy a lighthearted bromance
In the end Are You Here isn't quite funny enough to be a comedy nor does it take itself seriously enough to be a drama I would say that it's a dramedy but the tone is so erratic that it doesn't really fit in that category either
The film struggles to find a consistent tone between its attempts at broad stoner comedy fractured family quirks and a more serious examination of mental illness
The movie is the cinematic equivalent of dead air
Wilson and Galifianakis are very much playing to type as slick charmer and manic weirdo but the movie around them is much less predictable veering off in strange directions and never finding a consistent tone
Having penned various episodes for both Mad Men and The Sopranos what Weiner manages to squeeze into an entire season he's attempted to fit into almost two hours of cinema with this particular endeavour
Throughout After the filmmakers crank the trials of the film's Valentino family up to  sans irony or subversion
I've never had a movie try to guilt me into acceptance right before the credits rolled but I guess there's a first time for everything
Writer Sabrina Gennarino works hard to craft a layered drama but the result -- at least under director Pieter Gaspersz -- is hammy schmaltz
A frequently absorbing miserablist family drama shot in appropriately chilly winter tones
There's a fairly far-fetched twist that feels out of place in this realism-based drama
Viewers  are left with little to do but endure a lot of seemingly unprovoked family tensions while waiting for the inevitable revelation
How often does a film come along that truly deeply pisses you off
Kind of irritating in is purposeful disingenuousness and determined challenges to plausibility
Family drama set in upstate New York and revolving around a devastating secret which ultimately rings as hollow as the film itself
After catalogs so many clichs in the dysfunctional family at its center that the film could be taught in a screenwriting class as a lesson in what not to do
American tragedy serves as underfed underpinning for rote theatrics in After an unpersuasive ensemble drama that settles into a self-serious glide-path of inanity early on never to recover
Gaspersz embeds you with this family's struggles and almost makes you care about what happens to them all in the end
Straight manhunt-in-the-African desert genre picture with few surprises save for the fact that the hunted are women
Strangely unadventurous dependent on clich to connect the dots refusing the invitation to create a genuine nail-biter in an exotic location The feature isn't directed it's merely survived
Making the most of its shooting location but little else Heatstroke generates middling thrills with its underwritten overfamiliar tale of survival
A cheeseball B-movie about a woman and a girl combating arms dealers in the African desert that fails to generate suspense excitement or even unintentional B-movie laughs
The real act of survival is making it through Heatstroke all the way through to the end
While the characters can be irritating and problematic at times they are not unrealistic
Taking the bratty teen genre out of the sitcom and into the African wilds minus Africans doesn't do either much good in this Euro-safari female action hero thriller Touching on surviving a surly stepchild as much as assorted villains along the way
An uneven but entertaining look at the animal in all of us
A mediocre thriller with barely anything above middling basic stalk and chase fodder
Some elements work others we have seen a thousand times before
Not to be a killjoy but had Hernndez simply made a more straightforward conventional movie about the life and loves of a rising gay Mexican film director he might have had something
At one point my notes included the gut reaction This is awful
Hernandez merely revels in his own pretentiousness staging one dully limp encounter after another with self-conscious camerawork and absurdly stilted drama that renders the entire project a pseudo-porny slog
Director Julian Hernandez provides loads of sexy scenery but not much sense The film is heavy on slow sensual storytelling that more often than not demands viewers' intuition rather than offer clearly delineated characters and relationships
If the film defies conventional form it does so without the gravitas that conceptual cohesion brings quickly rendering its experimentation into gratuitous aesthetic masturbation
From Honey Boo Boo to the Kardashians from Chris Brown to Paula Deen from Angry Birds to Hoarders it spares nothing and no one
A Haunted House  occasionally tries to be a legitimate horror movie but just like the comedy it doesn't really work Basically this means you'll be hit with extremely generic jump scares every now and then
Calling this one an improvement is like saying that being kicked in the shin is better than being punched in the stomach Either way it hurts
Marlon Wayans' parody sequel is as inept and puerile as its predecessor but let no one say its screenwriter and star doesn't give it his all
A Haunted House  isn't the worst way to entertain a switched-off brain for an hour and a half but it's nothing you haven't already seen
Run in fright
A Haunted House  is not a movie It is a nervous breakdown
About as contemptible as filmmaking gets
The line between actual horror and lampooned horror tends to blur these days and since this effort is neither funny nor scary it won't help clarify
I almost laughed when Wayans pulled out a pair of nunchucks to stupidly battle a swarm of dark moths and nunchucked himself in the nuts
Marlon Wayans on his own has taken his family name lower than ever before even lower than White Chicks
Mostly the movie is seriously dumb and just a little depressing
Marlon Wayans is killing his own potential screaming his way into comedic oblivion
The A Haunted House movies are like a strange sort of exorcism They chase the demons away by having Marlon Wayans scream for  minutes
Though he's not for all tastes there's something admirable about Wayans's willingness to do anything for a laugh often reminiscent of Jerry Lewis at his most frantic
Repugnant
A few observational gags deliver but all the doll-humping and chicken-slaughtering will haunt you for days
A Haunted House  will satisfy only the basest of humours while simply repulsing or offending the rest of us
Unless you've seen every awful horror flick of the past five years you won't even get the jokes A comedic dead zone
What a nightmare A Haunted House  is the kind of film that gives lowbrow comedy a bad name It's just like the original screamingly stupid
A sweet-natured film that kids in the - age bracket will fall for
Even Banderas' character feels like a cheap knock-off who is not fit to polish the boots of Puss
It may have Antonio Banderas and Rupert Everett on board but this D cartoon about a would-be knight is more dreck than Shrek
An underwhelming saga told with the verve of a medieval video game
If imitation is flattery the makers of How To Train Your Dragon and the Oscar-winning Brave must never have felt flatter
It doesn't look bad but the spark of originality and interest is lacking
The frantic plot and shrill comic relief make for a disappointing dud
The action is clunky the jokes fall flat time and again and the script tries so hard to get off the ground that you can almost feel the wind hitting you in the kisser from its frantic wing-flaps
A strong cast on paper but you wonder if this is a collective sales pitch to make up for the lack of energy on the screen
Seeking to match the comic pizzazz of Shrek Puss in Boots and Brave Spanish-made animated adventure Justin and the Knights of Valour falls disappointingly short despite the best efforts of a very game mostly British voice cast
This disappointing CG animation fails to capture the sense of fairytale wonder that its narrative requires
A generally dreadful sub-par animation
Predictable animated swashbuckler with a few chuckles
Phil Alden Robinson's overheated dramedy feels disconnected from reality in every emotional way but at least he captures the impotent fury that hits everyone stuck in the wrong lane on Flatbush Ave
The film is supposed to serve as a reminder that low moments and all this is truly still a wonderful life Instead it's a reminder that Robinson and Williams have each made some wonderful movies But this isn't one of them
The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is hampered by heavy-handed direction and an unbelievable script with a schmaltzy ending
Considering its outlandish premise what the film lacks are any outlandish scenes-or if not outlandish then at least ones in the realm of the creative
Every scene between two people comes off like drunkenly shot video of a play rehearsal gone horribly wrong
The movie is predictably sentimental at its root but it's also meant to be comedy partly resting on Mr Williams's energetic but failed attempt to play a jerk
There's a rarely dramatized but profoundly understandable emotion that The Angriest Man in Brooklyn conveys the anticipation of regret
Williams of course has been doing a gruff-turns-to-lovable schtick as opposed to any organic acting for more than half of his motion picture career so his work here is what one might call dreadfully predictable
The film never quite manages to figure out what it's actually about
Phil Alden Robinson's film starts as a caustic comedy and becomes a teary life-affirming and sentimental journey of a dying dad
The movie feels more like it's stalling for time rather than filling itself with humanity and redemption
Brooklyn isn't heartbreaking heartwarming or funny Instead it's unbelievably awkward and when it isn't artificial it's wrongheaded
The cast is directed to often scream at each other at the top of their lungs making the would-be comic material all bark with little-to-no bite
This is the sort of monumental cinematic disaster that could only be made by talented people comprehensively bungling things
A schmaltz opera that indulges Robin Williams' most melancholy tics and themes
The Angriest Man in Brooklyn doesn't seem to know what chord to strike it veers wildly from madcap farce to social satire to sentimental family drama
The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is a film that's never sure which way it wants to lean leading to a very confused tone for a movie that has nothing original to offer in its clich-filled storyline
Tonally and creatively messy and filled with entirely too much shouting In the case of The Angriest Man in Brooklyn less would have been much much more
The message of the movie is not to waste the time you're given That includes watching movies as bad as this one
The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is like a brilliant clown stumbling off stage accompanied by a kazoo
The whole film is pretty enraging hideously acted apart from the main quartet and ends up viewing like a particularly racy Lifetime Original
This retrograde sex comedy is embarrassing for just about everyone involved
For a film so bent on naturalizing the presumably hilarious incongruity of the sexes it sure features lots and lots of that site of horror a naked male body And for comedic purposes of course
A dreadful sex farce with barely an authentic emotion credible character or plausible plot point in its midst
The movie doesn't work even as an instructional video
Fortunately not all was lost I did laugh four times during the movie But that hardly makes up for the pain during the rest of the time
A numbingly unfunny sex farce
Don Peyote is a delusional hallucinogenic journey into the mind of an apocalypse obsessed lunatic - a jumbled puzzle of ideas missing a few crucial connections
You feel as if at any moment anything could happen The problem is seemingly everything does
An incoherent film that's kind of a chore to sit through
This Don Peyote doesn't even have a windmill to tilt at
To write that this is the most appealing Fogler has been on-screen to date doesn't mean much but as scattergun super-freak-out cinema goes Don Peyote is almost patiently weird enough to work
All the controlled substances in the world couldn't improve a viewing of the execrable Don Peyote a tedious incoherent look at a paranoid stoner's emotional and spiritual unraveling
The film gets more woolly and unfocused many scenes feel improvised and only occasionally hit their marks
The worst American film I've seen this year
Should he direct again it is possible he will create a film worthy of his talent and worth watching Don Peyote however is as big a bust as the apocalypse of December
The most surprising thing about this comedy is that it's not very funny but then it's not meant to be This is a trippy odyssey into the mind of a drug-addled guy who thinks the world is falling apart around him
Unfortunately Don Peyote - for all its freakout ambitions bizarre visuals and copious relentless WTF moments - doesn't quite stick
It sounds dickish and empty to call Don Peyote indulgent but the film feels so personal that it never connects to any universal feelings of panic on the part of its character or by extension Fogler
an incoherent series of hallucination sequences that are neither amusing nor visually compelling
Where Don Peyote gets truly intriguing is when its transitions from mundane normalcy to a higher existence find their delineations gradually dissolving until we cannot tell which is which
It takes the easiest approach to every scene haphazardly juggling different tones without integrating them into a cohesive and consistent thematic identity
Perhaps because the fake-doc construct has become so familiar  the bar for turning that approach into something fresh and genuinely funny is simply too high for this movie to clear
Authors Anonymous may be about amateur writers But its own script needed a professional polish
Some good performances and amusing insights are undone by a mockumentary format that doesn't fully support them The stuff that works will ring a few bells for writers though and that may make it worth a conditional look
You get the sense that Kanner would benefit from attending a few workshops of her own
Stars Chris Klein and Kaley Cuoco and is directed by a woman who was once the casting director for MVP Most Valuable Primate
Not even this movie's foolish characters could fail to notice the irony there isn't a single moment of creativity in their own story
Pulling off a broad satire requires great finesse If as in the mockumentary Authors Anonymous all of the subjects are idiots why should we care
Authors Anonymous makes the same mistake it chides its characters for hero worship
Authors Anonymous proves too kindhearted to stick to its satirical guns even the documentary conceit recedes when it becomes inconvenient
The only reason to watch this picture is for the novelty value of feeling bad for Chris Klein andor Teri Polo To each his own but my recommendation is pass
Authors Anonymous manages to be sweet-tempered mainly thanks to lead Kaley Cuoco
Tiresome ensemble comedy pokes fun at publishing industry
Each of the players comes across as a one-note stereotype with the same kind of behavior going on in practically every scene
as is frequently the case when the same person writes and directs one talent is stronger than the other
The Outsider is so far-fetched it redefines the word preposterous and is made doubly untidy by the star's clotted accent
May Fairbrass the actor find a more interesting story than the one by Fairbrass the writer
As far as poor man's versions of Steven Soderbergh's The Limey go one can probably do worse than The Outsider
Fairbrass proves a hulking wannabe ass-kicker without much distinctive charisma and his leaden performance is matched by sleepy one-note supporting turns by the slumming-it Patric and Caan
Fairbrass moves stiffly through both the drama and fight scenes - as if he were underwater Supporting parts in Jason Statham movies may be his calling instead
Miller fights to create panic out of nothing employing a bland leading man and a repetitive sense of violence to snap this snoozer awake
The imposing Fairbrass makes for a formidable action hero but he's no match for the inert direction boilerplate dialogue and razor-thin characters he trounces with ease
The Outsider doesn't break the action movie mold in any way but it is an efficient little low-budget crime thriller that has the good sense to not overstay its welcome
There's not enough here for even an imported action hero to work with
A futile attempt to emulate the box office success of Taken
Given a lot of style this could have been another The Limey given even a bit more humor and flashier action sequences it might have passed for another Statham picture
The Outsider is a subpar version of The Limey starring a subpar version of Terence Stamp
Any entertainment value comes from peripheral things like wondering what excuse they'll find to get Shannon Elizabeth into a tight low-cut dress or why every single light source in this film no matter how small emits a blinding lens flare
Just know then that when the big caper finally arrives you will neither grasp nor care about what's going on
A thoroughly generic action pictureThe Outsider never rises above the clichs of an overpopulated genre
Sadly a certain baseline competence elevates The Outsider just barely into the realm of perfect forgetability
This isn't Taken unless that's how you feel after forking over  bucks to see this thing
Embraces its disposable B-movie leanings but remains mediocre even under these modest prospects
Blunt and simplistic there's not a moment in this thriller that feels inspired by anything other than criminal TV shows
I Frankenstein doesn't have much of a brain and is completely missing a funny bone
Aaron Eckhart tries his best but he can't breathe life into this monster of a movie
Ay-yi-yi Frankenstein
The last thing this film wants to do is make a believable world
There are a lot of people local and abroad responsible for this dismal film
An animated corpse of a film about a reanimated one
Devoid of any appeal that isn't concentrated around star Aaron Eckhart's impeccably-sculpted muscles this effects-laden lump of cinematic coal is as nonsensical and ill-conceived as it is boring
The numerous battles are confusingly handled and the actors aren't given many opportunities given the dialogue they're forced to speak
It is disappointing and you look at all the talent that's gone into it I was really underwhelmed by Strahovski's performance I must say
Mary Shelley's words come to mind Oh why did you create me
Only in occasional uncanny moments - when someone uses an iPhone or gets off a tram - does this world appear to intersect in any way with our own
I Frankenstein with its monster reinvented as a superhero is a fairly predictable action movie Shelley would not have approved
If a worse studio film comes out this year we're in deep trouble people This film is so bad it will hurt your brain And even if you leave your brain at home your spinal column will still objecta godawful lame-brained mess of a movie
Even the most avid action junkies would have a hard time not rolling their eyes at the blandness of it all
Even the title card is garish
I Frankenstein leaves itself open to be franchised but the chances of that happening are equal to Eckhart putting this film at the top of his resume
Humanity's fate hangs in the balance but it's hard to work up much excitement for the routine CGI-boosted battles between good and evil forces or for the less than sparky rapport between Eckhart's Monster and Strahovski's lissome blonde scientist
It takes less than four minutes to realise that this Underworld-style graphic novel adaptation won't keep anyone in the audience sitting bolt upright for long
Here's hoping there's no follow-up to the amazingly dull adventures of Frankenstein's Monster
The effects are poor the dialogue is laughable and despite Aaron Eckhart's valiant efforts the whole thing feels like a cheesy TV movie
Every time Jay Lifton's self-consciously quirky music kicks in it undermines everything else It sounds more like Lifton is making fun of indie comedies rather than participating in one
Jay Alaimo's tiresome dramatic comedy often seems as if it were assembled using the cut-up technique favored by Burroughs and his beat contemporaries in which clichs are thrown together and arbitrarily rearranged
Chlorine is lacking in just about everything wit dramatic momentum cohesion etc A wildly underdeveloped film
Derivative and unresponsive Chlorine tanks every idea it submits incapable of achieving the pathos it sets out for itself lost to filmmaking limitation and thematic inertia
A flat undercooked suburban comedy Or is it a drama Or maybe a kind of satire Regardless it's short on style substance or any clear raison d'tre
Unfortunately better movies have already been made about the subject from the underrated film The Joneses to the current Wolf of Wall Street
The film is about how adults can sometimes act like children and the unforeseen consequences that result We know because Kyra Sedgwick says it out loud in the third act
An apt alternate title for this lightweight comedydrama might be A Woodchuck in the Suburbs - for like the slightly more serious The Wolf of Wall Street it shows that no matter where they are greed makes people do crazy things
It's not a good movie and yet there are persistent good bits
Mired in the blahs the blues and the midlife crazies this poor man's American Beauty slowly sucks your will to live
Some of Chlorine's scenes go for a pat lifestyle satire that can be diverting enough but feels secondhand Elsewhere it makes wobbly overtures toward unearned dramatic poignancy
The admirable wit that's on display when it comes to subtle motifs and the poignant conclusion that resonates if you let it regardless of how predictable or not it may seem are all things that add up to a satisfactory feeling
The best that can be said of this latest take on Hercules is that it is over fast
Harlin's 's heyday of crafting fun fare becomes that much more of a distant memory
Through the centuries the legend of Hercules has survived It will survive the splat of this big BC cheese ball too
Tepid and tedious with acting so ludicrous that it's laughable
When awfulness reaches a certain point it achieves unintentional hilarity
Boldly unimaginative and ferociously derivative
Essentially a Monday Night Raw episode with mythological dressing
This origin story of the great hero Hercules Lutz of Greek mythology lacks even one semi-decent action piece
Mythical tale is violent and poorly executed
A misfire from top to bottom so complete that even when you think you have a handle on all the ways it can be bad it pulls out another one that's even worse
A low point is when Hercules kills the Nemean lion who seemed to be minding his own business in his forest not cool Herc even if he was all digital and as fakey as those stuffed cats they used to throw at Steve Reeves
Somehow more cartoonish than Disney's version which actually was a cartoon
The lore of Hercules has spanned centuries yet it's unlikely to ever see a more generic treatment on film than that of Renny Harlin's overblown origin story
This lousy attempt at a revival isn't even good for camp laughs
No one seems to have high hopes for it - though it might well help to pass a wet afternoon when it shows up on Netflix  minutes from now
Even dental extraction is more enjoyable to endure than this artistically bankrupt misfire
The film opens on a huge battle in the Greek city of Argos but it often ends up feeling like the director bought it cheap at the high street namesake
There's nothing here to engage the viewer or make them care one iota about what's occurring on the screen making it no wonder that this got dumped into theaters in the middle of January
Lunkhead Kellan Lutz is the demigod's density in Renny Harlin's -lite MSTK-ready retelling of the classical legend Think Jesus with muscles by the power of Greyskull
This film should be removed from theaters as soon as possible to avoid damaging the brains of people who have the misfortune of seeing it
The whole thing looks like a video game you'd rather not play
Hints of the opposing forces at work include a curious subplot about the need for the rule of law take that Kim Jong-Un nestling uncomfortably against the fart jokes
Weird as it may be with its dancing Korean pop star and all of its nuts wordplay The Nut Job isn't a tough one to crack Like most actual nuts it's pretty bland
A tired assembly of the expected celebrity voices Liam Neeson is a despotic raccoon and already dated pop-culture references the end credits feature an animated version of Psy leading the cast of animals in a dance-along to 'Gangnam Style'
Clichd contrived and needlessly convoluted The Nut Job is a real chore
The Nut Job feels like an archly contrived excuse to justify the groaning pun of the title
Pretty much everything in this South Korean co-production is slightly undercooked lacking the same degree of sprightly wit or dramatic punch regularly found in A-list studio product
As a CG-rendered Psy launches into a rendition of 'Gangnam Style' you'll be rushing straight for the exit
I'm not entirely sure who to blame for the muddled plot but I'm pointing a finger at the Koreans
This is chiefly about the spectacle and the gags which aren't frequent or original enough to compete with the likes of Pixar
The scriptwriters don't exactly deliver an embarrassment of riches in the joke department  Unless you're a sucker for rodent farts in which case they come up trumps
DreamWorks'  film Over the Hedge scampered through similar terrain with far slyer gags in its cheeks
The mixture of old school crime caper and Looney Tunes-style slapstick lends it a pleasant retro feel for adults even if kids might find Surly a poor relation of the acorn-obsessed squirrel Scrat in the Ice Age series
Makes as little of its furry leads as it does of its 's setting
Endless wordplay and dumb slapstick do not a rewarding animation make Pun-ishing
The good name of Canadian-South Korean animated co-productions has been sullied forever
Small undemanding children might find this distracting small tree-hopping rodents may be mortally offended
This week's talking-animal toon is bad enough to cause an allergic reaction in anyone above the age of five Everyone else is advised to take along two peanuts one for each ear
Children under seven will enjoy the slapstick nature of the fun and the irresistible Gangnam Style end credits sequence but parents might question why a film of this nature needs to feature humans using guns
This is the cinematic equivalent of a nut with no kernel a film with no heart
The filmmakers make sure their female protagonists constantly look immature and irresponsible and are intent on punishing them for wanting to have a good time
Doesn't live up to its title but it has more than its share of surprising bridesmaids-behaving-badly laughs
Best Night Ever seems marketed to women but made for frat house consumption
These quote-unquote filmmakers have nothing to offer the world of comedy or film and I've given up trying to figure out why people keep giving them money
Likely to be appreciated only by homeless viewers who need a quiet place to nap during the cold months of winter
This is an awful picture from start to finish -- a cruel cinematic joke perpetrated by two filmmakers who've turned failure into daily business
The film tries to make up for the lack of an original story with over-the-top antics that most of the time aren't funny
Serial spoofers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer hit a new low with their first 'original' comedy
Comedy requires a more delicate specific touch but here the air is slowly let out of the balloon as the scenes limp forward
Friedberg and Seltzer trade in one gimmick for another
Anyone who can sit through the whole thing and smile approvingly afterward gets my sympathy and also probably deserves some kind of award for delivering a performance more convincing than any ever seen in one of their films
Nearly every one of the film's attempts at comedy is clichd tasteless or forced-sometimes all three at once
What's right about Best Night Ever begins and ends with its cast who have a nice rapport The film however settles into a manic groove that is at once nonsensical and familiar
A st Century update of the Little Rascals' He-Man Woman Hater's Club episode where Alfalfa wises up and woos Darla his Neanderthal pals' protestations notwithstanding
If I read this screenplay I'd probably immediately ban Dean and Herschel from Hollywood
A screenwriter tries to fall in love in order to lend authenticity to his script about a man falling in love in Cavemen a tiresome film that itself knows nothing but other rom-com plots
It's truly a mystery as to how this movie got made -- and why anybody excluding horny LA guys would want to see it
A dismal rom-com for dudes that makes the average beer commercial look nuanced and plot-heavy
Apparently answering the unasked question What would happen if you told a -year-old at screenwriting camp to combine Swingers and  Days of Summer
Cavemen is an apt title considering how the sensibility and maturity of the film's characters don't seem to have developed beyond primal alpha-man impulses
Cavemen writer-director Herschel Faber has sketched such a thin and unfunny look at LA singles it should mark the death knell for movies about child-men on the make
Herschel Faber the writer and director here didn't bother fleshing out these characters enough to make us give a hoot about them
An unevolved romantic comedy better suited to the Paleolithic Era
Cavemen shows occasional glimmers of promise but ultimately winds up feeling just like Jay's blowjob story meandering somewhat dull and with little payoff
A blockheaded sigh-inducing retread that evinces neither any particular originality nor freshness of telling
What's in the bag A tedious self-consciously quirky postmodern noir featuring John Cusack and Robert De Niro in two of the more obvious money jobs of their careers
Grovic is lucky to have the professionals around as this shabby mystery has little to offer audiences besides unintentional laughs
It's clear that Grovic has seen a lot of Quentin Tarantino and David Lynch films But it's less clear what he's learned from them
Just Fleabag The Movie forcing you to watch this drivel instead of free HBO
The film has a nihilistic tone and its gallows humor may turn off more viewers than it seduces Not since Killer Joe has a film exerted this mix of attraction and repulsion
When thrillers are bad it's usually for one of three reasons Because they're ridiculous boring or disgustingly repulsive The Bag Man is the rare thriller than manages to be all three
David Grovic's directorial debut The Bag Man loves these clichs so much there's hardly room for invention to breathe
Grovic doesn't address his ideas and tactics with enough seriousness to justify sitting through such visceral affronts
The Bag Man has more attitude than panache Yes we eventually get to see what's in the bag But by the time its contents are revealed you may no longer care
There's much sub-Coenesque violence corpse disposal and skulduggery with the underhanded De Niro always maintaining the upper hand
Cusack and De Niro never quite embarrass themselves but the material is clearly beneath their talents
Whatever you do do not look inside the bag
A noirish kill fest stocked with offbeat characters lots of gunplay unlikely plot turns and a lavishly coiffed Robert De Niro
Even if this is your bag you can do better
Another failed attempt to revive film noir
There was a time when the possibility of Robert De Niro and John Cusack appearing in the same film would hold great promise Not anymore
By the time the intricate plot and not particularly satisfying payoff are revealed at the film's end many viewers will feel like they were the ones left holding the bag
A violent film with an underlayer of comedy - it works for me big time
With all of its time-wasting twists and gratuitous moments of sadistic silliness it feels like a leftover Pulp Fiction wannabe from  years ago
Robert De Niro brandishes an epic white pompadour that looks like a prank on eternal producer Robert Evans
Like a feature-length Saturday morning cartoon with dashes of violence so graphic you'd swear you'd just stepped into Ralph Bakshi's Wizards
Cleverly the animators rattle the frame on the tripods' exteriors to suggest the machines' Earth-shaking mass That's pretty much the inventory of the film's plus column
Considering that the fate of humankind is at stake War of the Worlds Goliath is remarkably uninvolving
Noisy battle scenes a la 'Transformers' and 'Starship Troopers' mar this pedestrian animated sequel to HG Wells' original story
War of the Worlds Goliath is just a few cereal commercials shy of a pointlessly cartoon marathon - violent messily drawn and lifelessly dragging
The film turns the miscommunication between cultures into an utterly lifeless romantic comedy best appreciated as a travel guide for first-time tourists to Paris
Pretty actors and pretty Paris locations don't rescue this limp collection of weary Euro-nationalist stereotypes and the lame situations the story puts them in
Girl on a Bicycle is like Micki  Maude minus the outrage complexity or crack timing
More dippy than romantic or funny
What wants to be a screwball comedy is run over by preposterous character motivation and a clunky plot
It's all light as a feather with Jeremy Leven the writer and director landing some good multinational jokes along the way
More of a foolish plod than a weightless rollick
Stupidity is an international condition How reassuring
The story and the circumstances are goofy enough to have been taken from an episode of Three's Company
It may be the worst romantic comedy I have ever seen and this is not hyperbole
From the opening scene Girl on a Bicycle falls into an unfortunate trap it can never quite escape from its humor feels entirely forced and predominantly based on national stereotypes
The we-are-the-world inclusiveness comes across like shameless pandering-a blatant effort to secure as much global financing as possible
Dark House practically drowns under the weight of mismatched horror tropes including a preponderance of loud-noise jolt-scares and idiotic character behavior
Dark House is one nutty horror movie but what's crazier still is how well it works - until it doesn't
The film's dialogue is knowing and the action sequences are elaborate but only in ways that advance the shady story toward its hokey denouement
Sometimes there's a thin line between terrifying and goofy
There's plenty of blood in the supernatural horror flick Dark House but what really defines director Victor Salva's latest effort is flop sweat
Mere minutes into Dark House it becomes depressingly clear that the deficit of imagination displayed by the title will not be made up for by the content
This is a film that skips all the foreboding and gives us scene after scene of just boding
Dark House is lame What it lacks in scares it more than makes up for in incomprehensible narrative choices
Salva certainly gets points for creative repurposing Much of what transpires in Dark House has been seen before just not all in the same movie
Dark House could really benefit from an Extreme Home Makeover because as it stands this is one architectural mess of a horror film
Doesn't always work as a cohesive whole but it does have more than a few good moments
Nothing if not predictable
A reminder of exactly how good Bridesmaids was this British facsimile fails to replicate its charms or laugh count
'The Knot' mostly plumps for the usual clichs and stereotypes
Knot funny
Relies too heavily on gross-out gags and laddish humour and fails to provide either likeable characters or believeable relationships
Every clich you can think of happens down to the groom not being able to find the church
Has the slapdash half-finished quality of a high-school play or perhaps a home video in which everyone involved is convinced that what they are creating is hilarious In fact it is not only unfunny and tedious but also hugely unpleasant
There are some gross-out toilet moments that I suspect are inspired by the recent US hit Bridesmaids but that movie had laughs and a lot of heart The Knot sadly has neither
All the film-makers do is show us things that raised a laugh in other movies - a bride with diarrhoea lads vomiting a little girl emitting obscenities
I would have happily jilted The Knot at the altar
Almost everything is reduced to gross-out moments that are about as funny as a yak's poo so that when love conquers all in the end you don't believe it for a moment
Bridesmaids The Hangover and countless others have adequately covered the same territory and The Knot feels like a poor cartoon-like imitation
The Knot is the wedding movie to end all wedding movies - because if this isn't the end of a trend heaven help us
If you can ignore the ill-judged slapstick and daft plot developments it makes for diverting enough entertainment
An offensive anthology of every loud lewd and loathsome wedding joke staged or screened between The Taming of the Shrew and The Hangover
Clearly intent on being a British HangoverBridesmaids hybrid this comedy romp doesn't contain a single laugh It doesn't help that all of the characters are deeply unlikeable or that the humour is literally centred in the toilet
The Knot finds a bumbling groomsman fishing for silver wedding bands in a diarrhea-filled toilet bowl Viewers searching for moments of wit or insight  might relate
veers into melodramatic territory with its lack of relevant context and its soap-opera script
The soapy biopic Diana starring Naomi Watts as the late Princess of Wales is more like Razzie bait than Oscar bait
the unnecessary tale of the Princess of Wales' last true love is a vapid banal and superficial exercise in cheap voyeurism
If you are going to make a film about the late Princess of Wales you are obviously going to choose the guy who directed Downfall about the last days of Hitler and the actress who played opposite King Kong
This visually polished Oscar-baiting docudrama chronicles her final two years and even in death she's a subject of invasive speculation
Despite its aristocratic pedigreerather tacky
Anyone who cares about this stuff already knows it
It's  a pity that her life is reduced to such a forgettable movie
Hirschbeigel says she's a miracle the screenplay leans toward monster I wish the film was interesting enough to make a case for both possibilities
The film can't find the woman beneath the faade despite Watts' best efforts Maybe she didn't exist Or maybe there's a better movie to be made
Not a lot different from whatever movie Katherine Heigl has made lately
Diana might have been flawed and scheming and love-starved but this film doesn't help explain that Nor does it illuminate the common touch and humanitarian side that endeared her to a global audience
Are the micro-biopics that don't even bother to provide overviews of their famed subjects' entire lives but instead lean on the spectacle of celebrity impersonation the new camp
If I didn't know John Hughes was dead I would have sworn he had written this film
It may not be anything all that special but it's harmless well-made and entertaining on its own terms
This affair hardly plays as being more than the pre-Dodi Fayed footnote it still is today much less deserving of this grand epic romance treatment given by the filmmakers
Yes Diana is the poor little rich girl but the opulent settings private jets yachts and chauffeured cars prove peculiar and distracting affectations
By the time Diana goes gay-clubbing to the sounds of the Pet Shop Boys' 'West End Girls' I began assuming the filmmakers actively hated their subject
Sets the proceedings within a misty cloud of conjecture
An incredibly depressing re-make of Notting Hill
It's a movie that thinks it stands for openness and cultural understanding underneath the poop jokes when in fact it manages to be offensive to almost everyone including people who like to laugh at something because it's funny
Fogel and co-writer Sam Wolfson - adapting their own off-Broadway play - take  a lazy approach to the cultural divides they aim to satirize
Oy Jewtopia may sound like utopia but watching it will give you a vision of hell
To call this winkfest toward an astoundingly retrograde sliver of Judaism offensive would be well offensive to the word offensive
Rather than finding a fresh approach to ethnic humor it relies on tired old standbys that have lost their punch
You feel sorry for everyone who's working so hard to prop up the farce - especially Mr Fogel the director whose work seems alternately desperate and lost
An appalling array of hideous ethic and gender stereotypes is what passes for 'humor' in this pitiful excuse for a comedy
Witless and asinine Not nearly as funny as The Hebrew Hammer
A funny walk on the meshugener side for those who can still laugh at religious stereotypes
Crass comedy relies on stereotypes and profanity
The girl-power subtext is about as sincere as a speech one student is given about climate change St Trinian's remains the franchise that will show you its knickers - and say whatever you want to hear - for a pound
St Trinian's  The Legend of Fritton's Gold is watchable enough thanks to the performances but it's not as much fun as the first film and the law of diminishing returns with sequels is in full effect
Judging by the first of the new St Trinian's films we shouldn't have expected more than rudimentary farce from the second
The slapdash sequel doesn't tamper with the winning formula which means lots more joyless slapstick crude stereotypes and girls behaving very badly
A cavalcade of schoolgirls filled out the press screening of this movie and very welcome to it they were
The report card reads Good when applying itself but must try harder
St Trinian's  isn't just appalling it's like scouring those final last-gasp instalments of the Carry On or Confessions Of movies looking for a laugh
St Trinians  achieves the near-impossible by being even cruder messier and more amateurish than the first outing
Diehard fans will lap it upbut it's difficult to see it winning any new converts
The piratical-treasure story is totally hokum but it's all peppy whiz-bang stuff livened up no end by Talulah Riley's fetching turn as Head Girl
If there is a cinematic equivalent of a Christmas panto this season it is surely St Trinian's  which is broad and ramshackle cheap and gaudy
Cheap ramshackle entertainment that's nevertheless imbued with affection
Oliver Parker and Barnaby Thompson do nothing here to destroy a winning formula which is cannily constructed to appeal to the target audience of teenage girls and nobody else
This jaw-droppingly hopeless sequel deserves to be packed off for a one-way exchange trip to Columbine
This contrived sequel is an interminable headache-inducing time-waster that never picks up any speed weighed down as it is by far too many characters and far too many slow-motion shots of the girls striding towards the camera
This sub-Carry On romp wearily coasts along on the lines of a rudimentary old-school farce rather than anything resembling wit
A film that flails about wildly in search of at least one half-decent joke Tragically the closest it gets is having a dog hump Colin Firth's leg
The tone is broad vulgar and exuberant and its hunt for lost treasure ends up inventively at the Globe Theatre Schoolgirls and those who like ogling schoolgirls will enjoy it
It's another panto for -year-old girls in which any given scene could - with only the addition of canned laughter - pass for something from children's television
Strident clumsy and pointless
Its content is culled from so many different movies that it seems the end product of a particularly unfocused pitch meeting
Live at the Foxes Den is like a sketch of an idea of what life might be like if you could keep doing re-dos
A slight movie that could have been significantly better with a little story doctoring
The script putters around aimlessly the camerawork was more varied on Cheers
Eyeballs will inevitably roll as the film sets a bar brawl to Sabre Dance and an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting to the sea chantey Drunken Sailor
A Russian animated adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale Snow Queen proves both visually cruddy and narratively muddled
Don't be surprised if your child asks to watch Brave or Shrek again when it's over
The message gets muddled with plot strands going every which way though the real culprit is some awkward animation
CGI fairy tale remake features the occasional fright
The visuals are poorly conceived with characters that are hardly more expressive than Weebles The vocal performances are uninspired and uninvolving
unlikely to stay long in your memory but Snow Queen might sustain younger viewers
This really is an idea for Generation  - but the social commentary is short-circuited by Antisocial's faulty wiring
This unconvincing techno-horror is too self-serious to be entertaining but also too silly to be taken seriously
If you can get past the fact that the flick is composed of  recycled ideas and  new ones you may find that something to like
The dialogue is pedestrian and the performances hardly inspired
an entirely underwhelming horror effort that's rife with incompetent amateurish elements
minutes of rancorous stereotyping lame bathroom gags and aimless often bafflingly outdated film references
Really a movie as lame as this one doesn't merit the expenditure of snark
Not so much a film as  minutes of terrible things happening on a screen
The Starving Games has the look and feel of a talent show put on by a high school whose imminent closing has not inspired any noticeable public outcry
It's safe to report that The Starving Games falls perfectly in line with their previous endeavors That's critic code for Dear lord this feature is insufferable please make it stop
The directors are from the Seth McFarlane school of comedy subscribing to the philosophy that if it's familiar even vaguely it must be funny
It's safe to say that no one in their right mind would find any of this clever or entertaining
Even a spoof fan has his limits and this one very closely approaches it
Lowbrow violent spoof with plenty of juvenile sex humor
In narrative and aesthetic terms there's something unholy about its mixture of inane clichs shallow music-video glossiness and incessant preaching
Despite appealing performances and glossy production values this faith-based drama has the feel of a lengthy church sermon
The creakiness of its storytelling and its unabashed preachiness betray its origins as a film designed to proselytize more than entertain It fails on both levels
There is no reason a film with an agenda can't also be engaging or thought-provoking But what we have here is not so much a movie as a blunt Sunday sermon
We're apparently supposed to root for these two to make it although Vanessa is outlandishly jealous and pushy
Suffers from the same ills as too many movies that preach to the choir a laborious length formulaic plot and dialogue and disappointing for a film that stars a rapper a stock score
A message film with the narrative sophistication of a recruiting pamphlet
Screenwriter Galley Molina based the film on his own experience going from drug pusher to minister but for all that this cliche-besotted film feels somehow synthetic in the extreme
This overlong drama plays like a threefold infomercial for Christianity the cheesy resort chain Sandals and Jeff Ja Rule Atkins the rapper-turned-actor playing drug kingpin Miles Montego
It egregiously lacks subtlety and too often resorts to excessive sermonizing
For myself and most folks expecting a movie it is too transparent an infomercial for the church to move the mountain
Even having God on the production team can't save this 'Church Girl' from its heavy-handed sermonizing
For a religion started by a martyred egalitarian hippie who hung out with lepers and prostitutes and was executed by The Man these supposed adherents sure seem obsessed with Earthly wealth Bad movie but a fascinating watch
Drug dealer's conversion story appeals to faith audiences
To call the acting amateurish does a disservice to hard-working amateurs everywhere
You won't believe a second of it
Solid performances by Ja Rule and Adrienne Bailon combine with an inspirational story to make an enjoyable film
It looks like everybody's lying and that's only because the acting is pretty bad
Runner Runner feels like a movie you've seen a hundred times on cable and hearkens back to numerous thoroughly average mid-budgeted dramatic thrillers of the mid-'s that will fill programming slots on late night forever
Unremarkable Internet gambling thriller where every move made is a losing one
No reason to run run to see Runner Runner
The eye rolls are plentiful during this far-fetched thriller that provides little insight into corruption in the high-stakes world of online gambling
Will Richie regain his moral compass Can our young turk turn the tables on his scheming mentor If you're hoping for a surprise answer to any of these questions then you are watching the wrong movie
This lurid and choppy morality tale is a pale copy of those Ben Mezrich books about Ivy League guys who get in over their heads by gambling
The mannered speech is fun the players are charismatic and director Brad Furman maintains an agreeably brisk pace
Director Furman and cinematographer Mauro Fiore make lovely work of the tropical light but the film has none of the loose-limbed energy of Furman's stealth hit The Lincoln Lawyer
The actors hit the jackpot but only in terms of their paychecks The audience gets a tension-free tight-assed Casino ripoff that leaves them thoroughly fleeced
Runner Runner gives both Justin Timberlake and Ben Affleck room to show what they can do and rather than pump up the volume they play it close to the vest as good gamblers would
Stars Justin Timberlake the perfect vanilla pseudoadult for a story of pseudoadult intrigues and pleasures
There's nothing glaringly wrong with it but it's so glossily mediocre that it's impossible to recommend to anyone not contemplating a lengthy plane journey
Justin Timberlake can not carry a movie on his own and this one sinks under his efforts Still the plot of the movie is pretty much run of the mill in its own right
Five years from now I can see this movie constantly slotted on networks like USA and TNT to fill the programming gaps
Its pedigree may seem like a trump card but make no mistake -- Runner Runner is bluffing
it's ultimately impossible to downplay the rampant ineffectiveness of virtually every aspect of the proceedings
A bland retelling of a familiar story that lies in the shadow of smarter and sleeker films like 'The Firm'
Mixes the vacuous and tedious slick and predictable smarmy and smug There's gambling lingo racism or sleaziness spouting from the mouths of male aholes conversations steaming with banal bluster and tropical scenes out of perfume and liqueur ads
Ultimately Runner Runner is really just a movie designed to provide some background noise as you update your Facebook
This painfully unfunny assemblage of would-be comedy sketches manages to make Movie  look good in retrospect
Surely there are phone apps that could write a funnier film than this
In the right hands and with a sharpness of wit there's comedy gold in taboo-smashing material InAPPropriate Comedy is overseen by the ShamWow Guy You've been warned
An inept brutally unfunny collection of sketches
There's no way anyone could have guessed just how offensive brutally awful grossly unfunny and absolutely poisonous this garbage could have turned out to be
I fail to grasp the point of making this movie
If you really want to remember those times Get out Horses Or Talking Heads  Or Blank Generation Preferably on vinyl with all the pops and scratches And play them Loud
CBGB generally feels like a misstep with self-aware characters all stuck in a movie that can't decide what it wants to be stylistically
CBGB ain't no party it ain't no disco it ain't no foolin' around
These are icons not accessories in some Hot Topic cover version of Teenage Lobotomy
Alan Rickman's lead performance highlights a sincere but insubstantial rock pic
a moderately effective overview of the club's early years distilled into sitcom-worthy vignettes without the kind of recklessness to make them seem truly dangerous CBGB is the pop-punk version of a raucous punk-rock story
'CBGB' is something those clamoring three-chord amateurs rarely were harmless
It takes a lot of effort to take the underdog stomping grounds of New York's top punk acts and turn them into the Central Perk from Friends-albeit with slightly more stain-but CBGB does it with total conviction
Warm gloss of nostalgia over the rise of the punk music scene in gritty 's downtown New York The spirit of musical and visual energy outweighs fanciful superficiality
The music rocks but little else does in Randall Miller's sitcom snapshot of New York's iconic punk incubator
The magnitude of what went on at  Bowery is largely missing though it's hard not to be at least a little bit stirred by the covers
A rushed chaotic and almost incoherent recap of the backstory behind the Lower East Side's iconic and now defunct punk music club
The film has energy to spare but the comic-book visual style is heavy-handed and the film merely skims the surface of the club's influence on the pop-culture landscape
By no stretch of the imagination is CBGB a well-made movie But since the lightweight plot and great music make this less annoying than Rock of Ages fans of the era may find something to enjoy
Ultimately CBGB tries to be too cute of a film about a great gritty topic but for those seeking an innocent trip through a pivotal time in rock it's better than a kick in the head
It's ' Hour Party People' without the wit and definitely without the love of the music it pretends to lionize
Under Rickman's pained gaze you wonder what he saw in the music although when you hear it it does take you back There's something there but CBGB isn't it
Plays like it was written and directed by people who have never listened to or heard of punk rock in their lives
You figure a movie that features the Ramones and Blondie would be so extraordinary and energetic but CBGB makes them seem so mundane and unimportant
The film is impossible to take seriously as a commemoration of Moultrie's life or Allen's prolific status because of its plethora of contrivances
A bit on the bland side but as a plus Jim Caviezel cracks his first on-screen smile in over a decade
The story overflows with reverence but is drastically short on passion or suspense
The movie's story is limp its romances are flightless and-despite the talented cast-its performances are toothless
Savannah does attempt to tell the story of the friendship of those two accomplished men but does so in a manner that is so astonishingly tone deaf confused and narrowly focused
Savannah should win some sort of award for most amount of times you'll ask They roped that guy into this turkey too
The film's tale ends up being less rich than its lovely Georgia settings
This is a Southern Downton Abbey minus the loopy plot turns and wisecracks that make that series so addictive
A movie that's essentially only of local interest
Strong performances and exquisite breathtaking cinematography barely compensate for a pedestrian underwhelming screenplay
Savannah's backstory may sound inscrutable to the world outside Southern Georgia social clubs that's because it is
Despite some fine performances the film has difficulty finding a consistent tone and the well-intentioned script emphasizes melodrama and sentimentality
The true story of Ward Allen a man whose life was not interesting enough to be the basis for a film
Attempts to leverage the horror genre in the service of inducing epiphanies but keeps tripping over its confused tangle of genres
cribs equally from Ghost Whisperer-like spiritual melodrama ghostly mystery and grisly torture porn
This silly throwback to the post-'Psycho' shockers of the 's offers a sluggish giallo-like murder mystery spiked with grotesque sadism
Cassadaga tries to scoop up enough tropes to satisfy a wide range of potential fright fans but lacks the cohesion to ever truly be effective
This eager film piles on common fears evil puppetry haunted homes and overly generous hosts So despite a sloppy and humorless execution it is scary by association
Anthony DiBlasi's Cassadaga is the state of the art in horror movie storytelling and the state of the art is horrendous
Cassadaga flirts with conventions of both paranormal horror films and more traditional serial killer thrillers but is marked by listless characters and indistinct dialogue
Cassadaga is so close to being hauntingly endearing but an overly Hallmark feel and laughable serial killer destroy any excitement or pleasure genre fans might be teased with
Watching the opening moments of the new independent horror movie 'Cassadaga' you might be forgiven for assuming the word is medical jargon for self-administered impulse penectomy'
A hodge-podge of horror tropes that frequently congeals into something fun
You probably saw the ensuing narrative of betrayal murder and undercover investigation on Silk Stalkings Miami Vice  Jump Street Hardcastle and McCormick Profiler or The Cosby Mysteries
An earnest not terribly convincing action thriller as generic as its title
If real FBI agents were as inept as those in Mission Park their average on-the-job life span would approximate that of a very lucky mayfly And if actual drug honchos were as careless as the ones presented here we wouldn't need the FBI
Four young men from a rough neighborhood are bound together by an ugly secret that continues to haunt them long after they've taken different paths to adulthood Feel free to stop us if you've heard this story oh about a hundred times before
This mission is a bit stilted from beginning to end
The bar for urban-flavoured dance movies has already been set pretty low but Battle Of The Year effortlessly leans back and limbos on below it
There's not nearly enough quality material to make Battle of the Year recommendable to anyone other than the most hard-core of dance fanatics
Eschewing shaded characterization and often basic sense while establishing what should be the high-water mark for most crotch-grabbing in a single film in
its dramatization of a US dream team's journey to the international showcase is leaden with predictable character types and storytelling clichs neither of which its well-executed but oddly infrequent dance sequences are able to overcome
Everything else in this pedestrian dance drama is either absurdly corny or just plain moronic though the feature does win points for being so earnest with its hopeless pile of clichs
After months of patient waiting  has finally produced a movie that's so bad it's good
Introduce female choreographer Explore misogyny for  seconds Become uncomfortable with ideas Disappear female choreographer
Athletic dancing and a patriotic theme make this movie better than it should be
Filled with fancy if frenetic footwork but weighed down by all-too-familiar plotcharactersdialogue
Battle of the Year is no Step Up D But then what is
In particular as mentioned the dance sequences are a mess which is the kiss of death for a film in this genre
If director Werner Herzog can do it with 'Rescue Dawn' and 'Little Dieter Needs to Fly' why can't director Benson Lee
Like those it imitates the film includes some energetic dance sequences and formulaic plotting that culminate in the obligatory final competition
Battle of the Year would rather use crowd-shot cutaways to convince you of the dancers' prowess than focusing on the stage
What could've been a fun 's throwback ends up more frustrating that it's worth
Dismal clich-ridden stuff
I didn't think it was possible but Battle of the Year is more pandering than the entire Step Up series combined
Josh Holloway tries his hardest God bless him but Battle of the Year D can't even be enjoyed as a blissfully dumb entry in its genre
Even when a dance movie is following the formula as closely as Battle of the Year does occasionally something you won't get to see anywhere else slips through
Despite the reasonable dancing scenes and passable acting by singer Chris Brown Battle Of The Year is a string of clichs stock characters and unbearable melodrama
It's difficult to know quite what is harder to believe The completely illusory and nonsensical nature of the absurd narrative Getaway or Ethan Hawke was able to make this in the same year he shone in Before Midnight
Little more than a series of repetitious chases that ploughs through the cliches like so many piled-up boxes barrels crates and Christmas trees All that's missing is some blokes trying to cross the street with a plate glass window
Undeniably silly and riddled with both gaping plot holes and unintentionally laughable moments
You watch the resultant wholly bloodless carnage with brain in neutral and eyes glazing over as you would a re-run of Police Camera Action at two in the morning
If you want to see a film make any kind of sense - or at least not to profit from attacking scores of others with a high-speed vehicle on the assumption you might save one person - then run for your life
One of the worst films of the year by a country mile
It's watchable enough but you wouldn't want to pay cinema prices for the pleasure
With its smashy-crashy aesthetic and endless scenes of hyperbolic car-nage Getaway exhausts the viewer's patience long before the finishing line approaches
If movies need us to suspend disbelief you have to supply your own clothes hangers for Getaway
CRASH Slow down CRASH Pull over Do it Now CRASH
What might have been a guilty pleasure is anything but thanks to badly-staged action scenes and a script that resembles a tick-list of action-flick cliches
Little more than a -minute chase scene this film is targeted directly at the Fast  Furious crowd but it has only one expensive car to smash up instead of many dozen
If you like car crashes and bizarre casting pairings have I got a movie for you If you like good movies yeah not so much
Getaway feels like a project that was undercooked needing snappier dialogue better shot coverage in its action sequences and especially a heavier dose of macho charisma
It's mildly diverting and it clearly hopes you won't point out if not its inconsistencies then areas where it could have tried harder
While the seemingly endless car chase has many literal gear changes Getaway as a film is a monotone experience
It's all you can do not to laugh Oh go ahead But be forewarned that there are many miles to go before we get to the end and it will feel like an eternity before any of it makes sense
The story is just an excuse for  minutes of fast cars and crashes  filmed in a grueling dirty too-fast edited fashion
If you want to enjoy 'Getaway' feeling like you might be a blue bottle that's about to go 'splat' on the windscreen rev it up
This is the antithesis of craftsmanship
Offers nothing by way of suspense intrigue or characters who rise even a little bit above the yawningly bland
With a strong cast and striking production values this thriller is sleek enough to hold our interest even if corporate espionage isn't a very exciting topic for the movies
Gary Oldman's gor-blimey Cockney accent and Harrison Ford's scarily short buzz cut are the most striking features of this disappointingly routine corporate espionage thriller
A far-fetched thriller that manages to feel generic in spite of its fairly novel setting in the world of high tech corporate espionage
The script conveniently leaps from one face-slapping coincidence to the next without as much as a knowing wink to the viewer a gesture which might have helped these laughable proceedings no end
The bland leading man lack of suspense and tedious panoramic shots of New York create feelings of inertia rather than paranoia
A movie as generic and forgettable as Paranoia deserves a title as generic and forgettable as Paranoia
Corporate thrillers just aren't what they used to be
Ford gives it the old college try and it's decently paced but it's not enough to elevate it from the muck and mire of a boring script made by an unimaginative director
The twists aren't surprising the perils feel artificial and even Hemsworth's chest gets a little ho-hum after a while
Even as a straight-to-DVD release this would fail to pass muster
A garbage movie
A couple of business rivals trying to steal each other's cell phone secrets is just not that gripping to watch unfold especially when it's anchored by such a dull protagonist
It's slickly directed by Robert Luketic even though it's all pretty unbelievable But in fact I rather enjoyed it
It's rather a slight affair
Paranoia a ho-hum thriller about corporate spying in the high-tech world comes off as a lot more preposterous than paranoid and it takes no more than a few frames for the eye rolling to commence
This is a film at odds with itself wanting to be a  percenter rallying cry but wallowing in and fetishizing  percenter accoutrement at every turn
There's nothing wrong with Paranoia that a stronger director livelier leading actors and several hundred fewer narrative conveniences wouldn't cure
It's a premise that stands or falls on the tense fate of a charismatic lead and dialogue that does not clang right off the screen a woeful lack of both ensures Paranoia more than falls -- it collapses
Paranoia is professional in every way but there's no pulse to it It is entirely adequate livened up only by a few supporting turns
It's easy to be critical of films which have no aim other than to entertain but if you're half way to Sandler's juvenile rather sexist mentality you will find more comedy highlights than you'll be expecting
As disposable and forgettable as its  predecessor
Somehow the word 'sequel' doesn't fit it would be like describing three months of agonising spinal surgery as the sequel to falling off a cliff
There was nothing remotely notable about 's Grown Ups and now we have a sequel that's even lazier
This is not a movie This is nothing but Adam Sandler hanging out with his pals and congratulating himself on how awesome he finds himself to be
Adam Sandler's follow-up to one of the most improbable blockbuster comedy hits in film history - Grown Ups took m in  - is a similarly plotless reasonably pleasant rough-edged comic ramble
The leads dampen the delivery with a noticeable lack of energy It's telling when the most charismatic comedic performance comes from Taylor Lautner
Grown Ups  is the culmination and epitome of laziness not just for Sandler his friends or director Dennis Dugan but comedy as a genre
Grown Ups  takes its rightful place in the pantheon of terrible films becoming just another one to avoid like your life depended on it
Directing once again is schlock auteur Dennis Dugan and the result is an  million YouTube video
Dreadful
Transgender jokes fat jokes always James happy to look stupid homeliness jokes mama's boy jokes -- the picture was made by people who like to put down people and it was made for people who like to tease others or watch others be insulted
The only good news is that the five friends in the original film have been whittled down to four
A witless clueless and utterly pointless sequel to a comedy that pulled in boatloads of cash but was beloved by absolutely no one
The single consistent throughline Grown Ups  seems to have in fact is its bigotry
Rob Schneider the butt of many jokes in the first Grown-Ups is nowhere to be seen Salma Hayek as Lenny's wife looks understandably tense and irritable throughout
A slothful indulgent sequel that sees a once-great screen comedian hit self-inflicted Sandlergeddon
Sandler's films have always been stupid but the early stuff is pretty harmless here the jokes almost always come at the expense of someone else the kind of needless bullying one expects of a YouTube comment section
Laziness wafts from the screen like a foul odor
It's a shame how lazy and pointless Grown Ups  is
Movies genuinely attuned to the nuances of female bonding are regrettably rare so it seems are ones that know how to make good on their promise without breaking just like a little girl
A multicultural mini-Thelma and Louise but far duller than that description implies Just Like a Woman peddles feminist empowerment with one-note didacticism
Miller and Farahani give strong performances as women bonding over their delight in both movement and their own beauty
A phony tone-deaf female fantasy
While one can sympathize with the subjects Bouchareb is exploring here his picture strives for a great deal more than it actually delivers
It's a shame Ms Miller has to try so hard to grimace so much to add emotional embellishment to compensate for a weak script
Not enough happens on this empowerment road trip to fill even a sub--minute running time and the climax resorts to trite unearned melodrama
Bouchareb fails to turn his outsider's point of view into new insights and instead takes the easy route falling back on familiar stereotypes in his tour of US misogyny and xenophobia
Just like its meaningless title Rachid Bouchareb's disappointing drama evokes better works without developing any distinct identity of its own
This well-intentioned buddy-road-trip flick lacks the danger the drama and the sex appeal that most moviegoers will be looking for
The problem with the film directed by France's Rachid Bouchareb from a script by Joelle Touma and Marion Doussot is that the men are mostly one-dimensional louts
Although branded throughout by a heavily mournful identification with these terribly wronged women's plights the film is nevertheless silly in the extreme
Like belly-dancing itself this drama is meant for the soul not the mind - or as Marilyn's instructor commands Brains Stop using them
completely falls apart amid a collection of heavy-handed cliches
It's stale B-movie rubbish of a barely watchable sort
Well at least the effects are fear-worthy
Nothing Left to Fear is true to its title Director Anthony Leonardi III and writer Jonathan Mills have let not one scary moment on screen
The familiar special effects are not the most disappointing element here It's the squandering of the talented Ms Heche who is given top billing but almost nothing to do
Deploys zero humor or wit before moving straight to the sacrificing of a teen girl always it's a girl
Memo to Rob Zombie Don't fear the competition
When a family is as generic as the Bramfords you get a little antsy waiting for them to be killed off one by one
Nothing Left to Fear gets your hopes up but by the time it's over the metaphorical throat of those hopes has been slit from ear to ear The film seems to make a mockery of you as you bleed out and a new song from Slash plays over the end credits
Nothing Left to Fear is a mild disappointment - as the foundation for a rich mythology that goes too unexplored to be memorable much less meaningful it leaves plenty left indeed to be afraid of
a far better remake of The Wicker Man  than its official  iteration as well as a complicated discourse on the contradictions to be found in faith superstition and the easy manipulation of both
Nothing Left To Fear benefits from a genuinely creepy atmosphere in its first half and from competent acting all round Unfortunately this isn't enough to overcome the problems that stem from a formulaic plot and a lack of ideas in the second half
It's a mind numbing and amateurishly directed horror outing
it panders to the viewer's basest instincts without even once interrogating them and presents revenge as something entirely unproblematic And when it's all over we like protagonistvictim Katie can just go home
There are glimmers of thoughtfulness here in the initial characterization of Katie and in her long slow recovery before she can exact her revenge but they're ultimately snuffed out by this mound of toxic trash
A dreary affair that will thrill undiscriminating fans of torture-porn horror and nobody else
You can't create a franchise using the ideas that surround I Spit On Your Grave and this unnecessary sequel proves exactly why
a grim god-awful experience
Welcome to the bottom of the barrel Population this movie
With I Spit on Your Grave  director Steven R Monroe returns and reveals that everything he seemingly did right in his first remake must have been accidental for this horrifically misguided sequel is everything you pray a movie like this would not be
A middling genre movie but it's oddly likable for its conflicted unresolved tension
Java Heat's title refers not to hot coffee but to the Indonesian island though caffeine is certainly recommended to make it through this tepid buddy-cop action flick
It's violent enough to numb but Allyn doesn't launch the effort to rousing heights of escapism In the end Java Heat works better as a travelogue than an international actioner
An action movie for people who don't mind clichd plotting lame dialogue and the low-wattage charisma of third-string Twilight heartthrob Kellan Lutz
Remember all those years when Mickey Rourke was languishing in cheap straight-to-DVD work that paid his rent and wasted his talents Apparently he actually enjoyed making those movies
This otherwise generic 's-style actioner benefits from the presence of the ever-colorful Mickey Rourke as an exotic villian
A better title for Java Heat might have been Java Noise since that is mostly what this uninvolving action film produces
Lutz  doesn't have half the charisma required to hold together this jumble of cheesy shootouts and chases but at least Rourke provides some unintended laughs with his comical attempts to be evil
The perfect macho date movie for that Type A juicehead in your life marked by Mickey Rourke's ever-accelerating descent into Lon Chaney-esque grotesqueness
The potential fun is all thoroughly undone however by an eye-roller of a script and a leaden lead performance from Twilight heartthrob Kellan Lutz
The film's anthropological interest in Indonesia is the smartest thing in an otherwise familiar scramble of kidnapped babes expensive jewelry and millions of bullets
Despite some appealing exotic locales the action sequences and plot twists are right off the genre assembly line
a wretched mess of an action film
It may suggest an Alien incarnate but once you get past its exterior it's as empty as outer space
Trite dialogue stock characters and bad-to-middling special effects make Stranded more tedious than scary or nerve-wracking
Mr Slater the only real name on view looks embarrassed to be slumming in something so cheesy But I liked the simplicity of the narrative structure and the lack of extraneous background information you get among most movie flight crews
Stranded doesn't tell a story so much as just present a series of sequential events
Alas Stranded isn't a for-the-ages howler -- just a terminally stupid monotonously unimaginative rehash of umpteen space-horror classics
Slater is supposed to be incredulous about the existence of the alien threat but he mostly seems incredulous about the script
Stranded stops at being merely seriously dull and trite rather than tipping into train-wreck silliness
Sometimes an earnest easily forgettable B-movie is just what you're looking for But rarely do you feel like spending  bucks to see it - especially when that appears also to be the film's entire budget
It's bad enough to have one film seemingly determined to sit down and nap between gore shots but there's a promise made at the end of the feature that more time with this aimless material is near
It may be time for everyone to agree that if you've seen one trapped-in-space-with-an-alien-presence movie you've seen them all
It's a scrappy unpretentious movie with nicely calibrated pacing but there's no logic little motivation and above all no personalities
When the opening action sequence ends you expect the film to back up or at least circle around eventually and tell us who these people are and it never does
Rote declamatory representations of paranoia fear delusion and counter-attack get cycled through in this movie whose title just describes how viewers will feel in its -minute grasp
If you're looking for a low budget greatest hits collection of some of the best science fiction of all time then I'm sure you'll love Stranded That is if the filmmakers could even do blatant mimicry correctly
Blu-ray Review Stranded is far from the worst of its kind but this is still pretty uninspired moviemaking with nothing original or different to separate it from the pack
A film composed almost entirely of jokes that were much funnier when you read them on Twitter years ago
Lacking a single honest laugh this is shoddy by comparison with the other Scary Movie sequels which throws it in a pit with Transylmania Breaking Wind and Stan Helsing
The scariest thing about Scary Movie  is that it actually made me chortle less than some of the silly horror flicks it's trying to spoof
For the art-house crowd who may I suppose stumble drunk into the wrong theater after too much Chardonnay there are nods to Black Swan and  Hours
If I ever have to watch another Scary Movie film I'll give up on writing cinema and society forever
This vapid vulgar insult to the intelligence couldn't possibly have been tested on any focus groups Can we all now agree that we've reached the cinematic saturation point with the rapidly-expiring Scary Movie franchise
It's supposed to be funny but you'd have an easier time reading a zombie's pulse than you would finding a single good laugh
The latest installment of the slick highly profitable parody franchise
A laughter vacuum whose race to parody the likes of Mama and the new Evil Dead remake didn't stretch to writing actual jokes
The filmmakers border on sophomoric desperation achieving a measurable shred of humor only in the outtakes during the closing credits
Don't Don't go see this Don't subject yourself to this Don't subject your brain to this Don't give these people your money and encourage them to make more of this
It's crude gross and probably wishes it was offensive but comes across as just lazy limp and unfunny
The only thing scary about 'Scary Movie ' is the thought of a sequel
This franchise has steadily gotten worse and worse with  being the all time low
This is a big waste of time drawing one more gasp out of a series that should have given up the ghost long ago
Enough Please
A boldly uninspired torrent of halfhearted slapstick interminable poop jokes and pointless pop-culture references a veritable tsunami of idiocy
Railing against Scary Movie V for diminishing the series' standards would be as effective as criticising Brooke Hogan for disgracing her proud family name And yet the fifth instalment of the Scary Movie franchise does do that
Scary Movie  is a reprehensible excuse of a comedy and should barely be considered a film since it's of such poor quality They don't make a dunce cap big enough for individuals this idiotic
The writers are on auto pilot once more relying on the It's familiar so it must be funny routine
The evidence here merely suggests that the only things more indestructible than horror-movie fiends are the tired tropes their sagas employ
One wishes it had spared us the remedial theorizing on media culture and artistic representation and license and less apologetically acted the part of a straight-up horror film
The film isn't as smart as it thinks it is and its characters are painfully generic
There have been a lot of shoddy found-footage flicks over the past few years but maybe none quite so shoddy as this
The always beguiling Radha Mitchell can't save this stunted procedural-horror combo
Again that the film actually makes time to set up a purpose for the found footage is marvelous The rest of Evidence doesn't share the same inspiration
Evidence tries to camouflage a standard serial-killer story with digital flimflam and intellectual pretensions
Neither suspenseful nor even comprehensible John Swetnam's dashed-off script carelessly directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi throws up plenty of red herrings - and a stupendously idiotic ending - but not a single character worth caring about
You don't really care who done it you just want it to be over with
A combination of chaotic phony found footage and whimpering models
The story's strained reaching plot goes so far off the CommonSense-o-Meter that there's more than enough evidence to convict this movie of impersonating a good mystery
Familiar predictable unoriginal but not entirely unwatchable
Evidence is actually three slightly incongruous film ideas in one almost effective package
Moyer plays scenes as if he'd rolled out of bed at noon after a long night of shooting in Bon Temps and had his script pages shoved into his hands five minutes before the director called Action
may lose the viewer before the surprises late in the film
There are interesting ideas here sadly let down by a weak central plot and formulaic realisation
While it's nice to see talents like Keaton and Sarandon in The Big Wedding it's ultimately frustrating seeing their talents wasted in Zackham's paper-thin excuse for a rom-com
You'll run out of appendages on which to count the clichs
A frothy and harmless confection that squanders the on-screen talent
It's not the sheer predictability of the ensuing frolics that's hardest to take or even the dismal attempts at humour  but the sheer misery of watching actors you once respected demean themselves in such utterly worthless fodder
This is one of those farces you come away from thinking the French would have done better Then you discover that the French have already done it and better
Pure claw-your-eyes-out cinema
Disappointing poorly conceived comedy that's both emotionally unconvincing and depressingly low on laughs though the performances ensure that it remains watchable
This is not so much Meet The Fockers as meet the shockers The jokes are something old nothing new mainly borrowed and sadly blue De Niro is a shadow of his former shelf not so much Taxi Driver as taxidermy
Oh God this is humiliating trills Diane Keaton and she never said a truer word
Big wedding Big fat nothing more like
An all-star cast very nearly goes down with the ship as filmmaker Justin Zackham The Bucket List indulges in relentlessly farcical silliness
With De Niro inexcusably using what is for many people the single most obscene swear word this is well off target
At least somebody does fall in the swimming pool It's Robert De Niro Unfortunately he resurfaces
Sinks to new levels of horrid
Built on chaotically disparate tones and extremely broad jokes that never hit their mark The Big Wedding is completely devoid of laughs
Behold the unholy matrimony of hack-job romance and whack-job comedy Witness the blindingly bleached marriage of house-porn and cocky Caucasian privilege Suffer the union of former A-list stars and express-cashed paycheques
What it desperately needed was more originality I suppose Zackham thought that if he just got a great cast and sprinkled enough humor into it then those would be enough to cover up all the flaws in the script Unfortunately he was very much mistaken
The goofy characters waltz through plenty of offbeat situations but that's not enough because quirky and funny are not synonymous
No  apenas uma m comdia  mau Cinema
Some scripts can be saved by a good cast that delivers the material with as much chutzpah as possible And then there are some that are simply unsalvageably dreadful
An extraordinarily undistinguished comedy from director Brian Herzlinger
There's not much that can kindly be said about either the goofy script or awkward direction
Piscopo isn't just too good for this film he's too good to be giving it this much effort
The movie's message delivered in song at the end seems less like a credo than like an excuse Sometimes all you need to do is try
The movie is called How Sweet It Is and oh no it ain't
How Sweet It Is may be sweet in spirit but as a movie it isn't so you know sweet
It's brimming with bold ideas but none entirely come off despite a willing cast and solid performances from the leads
Scant time travel logic aside Dana Lustig might finally have found her groove with this unassuming low-budget sci-fi
Slick and ambitious but also soapy and unfulfilling
A Thousand Kisses Deep certainly has ambitions but the film struggles to lives up to the Leonard Cohen poem it's named after
Lustig strains for poetic meaning but comes up empty-handed Unless that is you happen to like cod-Freudian naval-gazing
The initially-promising story about a haunted woman who travels back in time to reveal the truth is as unconvincing as they come
Nicely glossed melodrama that lacks the poetic depths of its musical namesake
The script's understanding of psychoanalysis seldom rises above the Wikipedian and David Warner's cryptic Freudian janitor rather put me in mind of the mystical Jacuzzi repairman played by Chevy Chase in Hot Tub Time Machine
A vaguely ambitious but finally wretched exploration of alternative poverty-row realities
Only see this if you have a time machine which allows you to go back and regain the  minutes you spent watching it
After a mildly intriguing first  minutes most viewers will want to take an hour-length jump into the future to put this idiotic film behind them
Neither proper science fiction nor serious romantic drama A Thousand Kisses Deep is in the end too stupid to be worthwhile
It just feels rather silly as if it assumes such a reverent audience couldn't possibly need anything as pedestrian as believable characters or a likely plotline
This superficial family drama will appeal to many Reds' fans but it's also so twee compared with Danny Boyle's Millions  that it's unlikely anybody else will want to go near
The idea is sweet enough recalling Africa United but the execution is painfully amateur Improbable hackneyed and very dull
Barely five minutes in Will is already choking on an airless script and bumping desperately off its flyweight supporting players
It's a silly symphony of embarrassment a sentimental journey along a road paved not with yellow bricks but red cards
Come back Bella and Edward - all is forgiven
Yeahumnodon't ever do this again please
It's bewildering how sci-fi aficionado Andrew Niccol Gattaca The Truman Show could mastermind such a parasitic mess
There's much grave talk of souls in this sci-fi romance Ironic then that it ends up being such a soulless and trifling affair
Three bodies plus four minds is some fertile arithmetic but The Host can't be bothered with the intellectual or kinky ramifications of its setup
So badly scripted performed and directed that it literally destroyed my faith in humanity
It's a reasonably intriguing premise but the alien invasion soon takes a back seat to the kind of tiresome teen angst where crucial plot points hinge on a kiss
Resistance is futile
Niccol crafts some arresting imagery though the slow pacing and droning new age score makes everything feel like an endless Ambien commercial
Just like her Twilight series Stephenie Meyer's  novel The Host becomes another feature in which people are standing around and brooding    Proof that it's not easy to make thoughts seem riveting when little is happening
This limply directed solidly boring slice of sci-fi twaddle features humanoid aliens who spend much of their screen time staring blankly into the middle distance with glazed eyes About  minutes into this dross you'll know what that feels like
And you thought Twilight was bad
Catnip for the cooing teen female set but far less engaging and rewarding for anyone else
You might despise the 'Twilight' series and still find something to appreciate hereat least it's original
Beyond Meyer's trite-and-untrue formula supernatural love triangle exotic locale family values and kisses as daring and transgressive corpse-stiff dialogue flat action sequences and a confused allegory make this movie particularly stultifying piffle
It's all very confusing and not very interesting
What sort of worked on the page crashes and burns on the screen as even an actress of Ronan's caliber can't make these self-debates anything but ridiculous
Oh the silly movies we must endure The Host is perhaps one of the most brain-dead sci-fi love stories to come along in many years
The Host fails as a romance but it also struggles as an adventure film The body-snatching angle has been done before and the aliens aren't menacing enough
Those who found Twilight nauseating will find The Host has the same overlong runtime cornball characters and artificially pumped up romantic stakes
Unfortunately no one here is especially sympathetic and the shock both parents seem to feel on discovering their kid is a grade-A brat is hard to believe given the general sense of verisimilitude
All too often the film borrows from the ideas and conventions of the pysch-horror without giving either them or the audience enough respect for it to work
The conflicting speeds of the feature create chaos derailing a familiar but promising junk food thriller which tries much too hard to keep the viewer off the scent of a mystery they will likely show limited interest in to begin with
A psychological thrillercum horror tale about a dangerous fellow with three personalities a movie that proves Robert Louis Stevenson right two are fine more's a crowd
Tired and cliche ridden yet watchable due to its stars Julianne Moore and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers
The film belongs to a long tradition of horror films that offensively suggest that all atheists might as well hang a Welcome sign up for the devil
Ultimately the silly material overwhelms the style
The end credits which seem almost as long as the movie itself dementedly thank everyone from the citizens of Pennsylvania to William Wyler Howard Hawks and God What an insult
What unholy spirit could have possessed Julianne Moore when she signed on for the sort of throwaway horror flick that would normally star unknowns and go straight to DVD
Souls is regrettably sick with that familiar disease afflicting movies of this ilk ostentatious hollow moodiness that spreads like an unwelcome rash
A preposterous supernatural thriller that inexplicably managed to sign up Julianne Moore to star
Beginning as a psychiatric freak show  Souls eventually trades serial-killer intimations for backwoods bad mojo before becoming just another dimly lighted pop-up-stalker flick
Convention-straddled to a significant fault  Souls is however notable for its performances and for sticking to its creepy contained formula far more at least than most recent horror films
Psychology-themed horror tale goes a little nutty in the end
There is a nice sense of dread here a level of suspense that slowly dissipates as the movie meanders toward the exhausting end of its one hour and forty five minute run time
A wretchedly unwatchable train wreck of a film that sorely misuses its talented cast
If not for the presence of the extraordinary Moore it wouldn't be worthy of any attention at all
Julianne Moore cashes in a small segment of her reputation in the starring role of this overwrought psychological thriller
Souls is as boring as they come It's a horror mystery with not a single second of suspense and a batch of uninteresting and naturally boring performances
A patchwork conventional and oft-told story that's a whole lot sillier than was probably intended
The homeschooling segment is funny The restnot so much
Misconceived rag bag of potty-brained skits starring gullible big names including Kate Winslet Richard Gere and Gerard Butler
As a film critic I've seen nearly  movies over the last fifteen years Right now I can't think of one worse than Movie
If you're interested in seeing Oscar winners Tony winners and a bunch of genuinely talented people act out the raunchiest most inappropriate material you're likely to see this year Movie  fits the bill
It is utterly disgusting throughout
It rather boggles the mind how so many micromanaging handlers allowed their A-list talent to participate in a production that looks funded from a frat-house's loose-couch-change collection
Despite all the gross-out humor the most offensive thing about this is the lazy filmmaking every shot feels like a first take and the haphazard editing precludes any comic timing
Be afraid Be very afraid
The very fact that all gave so willingly of their time and talent to feature in such a grotesque spectacle is sort of endearing
It's a full-scale disaster a misfire of megalithic proportions that somehow managed to snare an A-list castThe reviews have been so relentlessly acidic that it could acquire a so-bad-it's-fun mystique that turns it into a cult film
Absolutely disgusting nauseating misogynistic racist cruel void of any common sense
To fully enjoy yourself from start to finish it will help if you've got the sense of humor of a middle-school-aged sociopath For the rest of you I suggest eventually watching it on your phone
Being punched in the face was easier that watching this movie
An execrable waste cooked up by a hell's kitchen of directors and writers It's death-of-laughter by committee Its title Because it's like one of those many asteroids out there--a dismal chunk of rock hurtling through an empty void without purpose
a bad idea handled in a hackneyed manner
It feels like somebody strung together some of the worst SNL skits and called it a film
It's got some clever sketches though to really enjoy them one must have the sense of humor of a -year-old boy Fortunately I do
The greatest waste of A-list talent since Garry Marshall made his last film
Here's a movie that's way way more interesting for the story behind it than for anything that actually happens on screen
There is not a single redeeming quality to this absurdly inane film
The film is a pleasant watch filled with nice little moments of comedy and tenderness and optimistic about the fate of dreamers who happen to be a little slow out of the starting gate
These -D characters might as well be wearing T-shirts that say things like Predatory College Professor and Self-Obsessed Father on them
Roberto Faenza shoots his Manhattan-set action with a glossiness that's as bland as the soundtrack ballads
It might actually make audiences understand the urge to bully
His pain may be useful to James someday but to viewers it's annoying right here and now
The actors work overtime to make this would-be sensitive study of troubled youth work but are undone by the windy triteness of the script
It's not exactly a trainwreck of a movie but Someday This Pain is so void of depth and meaning it often resembles a parody of the bruised teen subgenre
Several kinds of excruciating
The film takes itself too seriously while it tackles familiar territory
This cliche-ridden coming of age story is as painfully awkward as its troubled teen protagonist
Listless coming-of-age drama about teen's ho-hum problems
Despite strong performances from Keanu Reeves Bojana Novakovic and Adelaide Clemens Generation Um doesn't give us enough of a story to keep us fully invested throughout its running time
a bafflingly irreverent meandering character study that resurrects Reeves' trademark inscrutable delivery providing the actor with his most characteristic performance in years But that's not quite enough to salvage the movie
The levels of insight provided into the characters are exactly commensurate with any conceivable viewer's interest in learning more about these nonentities
Reeves is front and center in a thinly sketched narrative anchored by little other than his presence
Generation Um devolves into a heap of sub-American Beauty profundities and strained confessionals
It's a patience-tester salvaged only a smidge by Reeves's uncanny ability to remain perfectly still while his co-stars strap on acting school rocket packs and pinball around the frame
The point of the movie seems to be like inarticulation or something
Um winds up as empty as its mean streets are phony
What does it add up to Um  I have no idea and don't really care
A slapped-together sub-mumblecore exercise that at times suggests a feature-length expansion of s Sad Keanu meme
Meandering and affected this tedious character study is as aimless as the lives it depicts
Director Mark L Mann seems to be searching for the meaning in aimlessness and in lowered expectations But too often the narrative left me feeling the titular um
Neither the film nor the film within the film hold our attention Bummer Keanu
A single plotless day in New York in the company of Keanu Reeves feels like a life sentence
While Reeves brings more depth to his character than the script warrants the film overall lacks compelling characters and winds up depressing instead of profound
As far as derivative crime sagas go Paul Borghese's film might represent the new gold standard of shameless barrel-scraping
Once Upon a Time in Brooklyn's vision of the Mafia comes filtered through a needlessly complex screenplay as if the creators felt the need to prove they've seen a few Arnaud Desplechin films alongside Goodfellas
Cathy Moriarty and other Scorsese alums pop up but these mean streets feel too derivative to thrill
Packing the screen with wiseguy-story regulars - like Vincent Pastore and a limp Tony Darrow perhaps distracted by his recent legal difficulties - is fruitless when your movie is as pathetically inept as this one
GoodFellas is just one of the movies that did this all much better before
Solid performances can't save the film from its banal convoluted screenplay that leaves no room for interpretation or subtlety
Perhaps because of its subject's unexpected death Hating Breitbart leaves you wondering how far Breitbart could have taken his crusade for new media to topple the old and take back the power of storytelling
Overall Hating Breitbart is conspicuously parsimonious when it comes to providing biographical info about its subject
This is less a documentary than a wholly uncritical celebration
as far as this film is concerned Andrew Breitbart was a great American a nearly mythical figure like Daniel Boone Who as members of my generation will remember also fought for America to make all Americans free
You have to give Hating Breitbard credit No other film on the subject would be as slavishly non-objective as this one
Lacking the objectivity or contextual analysis to more fully examine the important issues it raises it's a minor chapter in an unfinished story
Docu one-sidedly reveres late right-wing media provocateur
Marcus makes little effort to illuminate Breitbart's character or motivation so this high-pitched portrait ends up a little flat
A shapeless uncritical documentary
Hardboiled noir play-acting doesn't get more sluggish than in this leaden tale that blurs the line between reality and delusion in a way that's less intriguing than simply confusing
The movie tries to achieve something we've seen done so much better in the past without the level of writing necessary to make it work
It's almost as if Jacobson and writer Matthew F Jones changed their minds at the last minute leaving us all in the lurch
For some reason Stephen Dorff has been cast yet again as anybody
Tomorrow You're Gone looks like it was made after reading the first chapter of Noir for Dummies
The makers of Tomorrow You're Gone were definitely going for a specific something with the film The question is - why
Despite its great cast this murky thriller disappoints because of a lack of cohesiveness and less than stellar production values
This turgid and pretentious thriller is all style no substance
There are intimations throughout that Charlie may not have the strongest grip on reality though there's nothing ambiguous about the picture's overriding tedium
Tomorrow You're Gone may be overly confusing from start to finish but there's no confusion about the fact that it's simply not very good
Assuming a series of increasingly empty noir postures and grimaces Dorff expedites the plunge into frustrating pointlessness of this curious psychological drama
Simmering undercurrents of dread and distrust drive this updated Bonnie and Clyde set in the dark inner city
Stephen Dorff struggles to rise above the plainness of the film's premise
Whilst Dorff is fairly blank in the central role Monaghan is superb creating a character whose unlikeliness doesn't detract from her believability
Despite a lavish dose of gothic style and the occasional inspired flourish as when surveillance monitors are overcome with home movies of dead children The Condemned's trek toward absolution is pretty familiar
So tame and so completely boring that to call it a horror film is to insult the genre
A Puerto Rican drama that straddles the line between tame horror movie and marginal ghost story
It adds up to a methodically bland intellectually sluggish exercise in guilt-tripping that's nonetheless still more interested in its rich and sexy characters than the supposed unfortunates
You may hopefully think you're watching an art-film pastiche along the witty avant-garde lines of something by the Chilean director Ral Ruiz
If you like psychologicalsupernatural thrillers that are relentlessly grim and creepy this is recommended Others who like their horror to be at least a little on the fun side may find this just numbing
The Condemned is nothing but a creaky faade
A would-be thriller whose intended horror-tinged chills register as ho-hum hokum
You know a fright-flick craze is in danger of running its course when Marlon Wayans comes along to broadly belatedly spoof it
I thought coming down with the flu would be the worst thing to happen to me this week But that was a few days ago when I was still sweating it out in bed and coughing up my lungs before my immune system was further compromised by A Haunted House
Truly one of the worst horror spoofs of all time and there have been some hideous failures over the years Poorly written repetitive and offensive on every level without being funny Wait I'm just getting started
This is the first film I've seen that depicts rape perpetrated by a bisexual weed-smoking ghost and probably the last
Somewhere between a spoof on Paranormal Activity and crazy fun film gathers pace and comedic momentum as it goes The cumulative effect especially if enjoyed in a group of relaxed friends is likely to be hilarity  black dude jive kinda hilarity
Dreadful
The moments where you feel the cast are off-script and riffing are fun if not actually funny but the most horrific thing on offer here is misogyny
Sporadically misogynistic homophobic and grade-school puerile in equal measure it is also not without the occasional laugh-out-loud moment
A painfully unfunny overly familiar send-up of recent horror franchises
Clearly what the world needs right now is another low-rent horror movie spoof And this one's not bad Sticking to Paranormal Activity for its premise it actually produces some pretty funny moments
Just another in a long line of mercilessly unfunny spoofs
This Haunted House needs a KEEP OUT sign nailed to the door
This send up of the Paranormal Activity films provides a few laughs here and there but for the most part its crude and clichd script is ridiculously stupid embarrassingly over the top and occasionally offensive
There's just an odd recurrence of homophobic humor in the entire movie that compensates for lack of actual humor
Yet another spoof from Wayans and Alvarez this movie isn't nearly as bad as it could have been they also produced the resolutely unfunny Scary Movie  and Dance Flick
Heck worse films starring Robert De Niro have been released this year
Frustratingly there's actually talent on-screen that hints at what could have been a cleverly comical take on the found-footage genre
Too banal to be offensive it's certainly one to miss
A Haunted House is technically inept monotonous and stiflingly cheap-looking How this cost  million dollars to produce is beyond me
Neither worthy of my laughter nor capable of inducing sleep No this is one of those rare films where its badness turns the cogs of your brain
Not exactly original but this slick chiller hits enough right notes to carry the old tune well
Early scenes when strange sounds fill the studio and a phone keeps ringing are creepy enough - but when a hidden message is detected on a track the film crumbles from tinnitus
Badly directed poorly written and ultimately scare-free British horror flick that looks embarrassingly cheap and completely wastes its talented cast
Its influences from The Conversation to The Shining are worn like cheap tattoos while its jittery editing and blurred photography fail to hide the yawning emptiness at its centre
The horror dial's turned down to mute in a British fright flick about a dead rock star haunting a recording studio While there's the germ of a good idea here the execution is just terrible
Eitan Arrusi's movie appears to have been shot through dirty glass and edited in a blender - it may drive you mad
In the end this looks like just another crass unimaginative and heavy-handed British horror A shame because the opening  minutes or so are interesting and atmospherically creepy
Occult thriller Reverb soon gets bogged down in implausibility and sloppy writing
It just about works as an exercise in empty style but that doesn't compensate for the small matter of its near-total incomprehensibility
The whole thing takes itself so seriously it's not even good for a laugh Maybe it's scarier if you play it backwards
Like a quadruple disc concept album from the most indulgent prog-rock act of the s this is a complete mess
Much of the doc plays like a moderately well produced but tediously uncritical making-of feature that could easily have been included on the opera's DVD release
Suffers some dramatic slackness from the inevitable drawing board tedium of performance preparation
It reduces Helnwein to simply being a determined intransigent creative type
Thanks Gottfried but exploitation does not equal art
A lack of focus and a meandering approach afflict this study of an artist at work
This repetitive documentary from Lisa Kirk Colburn banally strings Gottfried Helnwein's musings together with creative wrangles
A Dark Truth is one of those unfortunate projects whose component parts are immediately at odds with one another
Can't come up with a single reason to recommend this leaden excuse for an eco-thriller which one Damian Lee claims to have written and directed
The film's heart is in exactly the right place but there's not a brain in its pretty little head
Pedestrian action scenes that wouldn't be out of place in a direct-to-DVD cheapie
An interesting baby step toward a larger discussion of the water rights issue but there's not enough integrity here to savor with all the violence and cliche drowning out the lasting message of the movie
A self-serious eco-thriller assembled with a competent but heavy hand
Generic thriller has plenty of dead bodies few surprises
This eco-thriller's message is an important one but there are too many slow-moving scenes and too much screen time with characters just staring at each other
There are many roads to hell and A Dark Truth travels the one paved with well-intentioned efforts to wrap complicated socialpolitical issues in genre movie clichs
A slog of a thriller that tries for relevance with an environmental message A Dark Truth's biggest mystery is how so many name actors ended up in this torpid turkey
For all the attempted intrigue and mayhem the film is dullsville mired by a poky script unremarkable action and the hard-working Garcia aside uninspired performances
A lightweight flick about a heavy-duty subject A Dark Truth plays like a TV movie back in the days when TV wasn't worth watching
never moves beyond a slow jog even in what should be the most exciting moments
Garbage
A father-son heart-tugger wrapped around a mushy reconciliation rom-com sprinkled with tinsel of shiny Hollywood supporting stars acting like they're in another movie entirely
Dennis Quaid hammers away at a nothing role as Thurman's husband an adulterous alpha dog it's nearly identical to the one he played earlier this year in What to Expect When You're Expecting but who's counting
Rigidly formulaic and shamelessly sentimental
Not quite as bad as it sounds despite the corny game plan
Hitting our screens on New Year's Day let's cross our fingers and hope that Playing for Keeps isn't an indication as to how the rest of  will be for cinema Best to get it out of the way early I suppose
Everyone involved deserves a script with more wit originality and sense of purpose
Even an actor as capable as Dennis Quaid is incapable of wading in to save it
Sadly wastes its star-studded cast and has very little to offer in the way of laughs and touching moments
In the long ignoble tradition of naff romcoms starring Butler this stands alongside The Ugly Truth and The Bounty Hunter as the worst of its kind
Even the usually reliable Dennis Quaid flounders as a fellow parent in a film that is at least slickly put together but is ultimately a sheer waste of talent
The comedy has its moments but they are few and a high-powered cast which also includes Judy Greer and Dennis Quaid give mostly low-powered performances
If this was a biscuit it would be an own-label digestive full of sugar and trans fats - but suited and booted in a glistening wrapper
Did Gerard really leave the UK and a guaranteed pundit spot on Match of the Day for an automatous son and callous wife Playing for Keeps asks difficult questions like these but provides no satisfying answers
An own-goal shambles of bland characterization comic shtick exes-still-in-love clichs and lazy implausibilities Playing For Keeps plays down to the ugliest American stereotype of soccer-dull to the point of brain-death
a half-hearted comedy about the perils of former professional athletes that unsuccessfully tries to force together elements of domestic melodrama and romantic farce
All the characters and their motivations are banal at best and half drawn at worst leading to the question why didn't this end up on The Hallmark Channel starring TV's hot-tail of the moment
No matter what kind of drab derivative fluff you prefer this exceptionally toothless comedy has something to offer
a celluloid own goal
Someone maybe should've told this guy if you want to rekindle a romance with a woman you probably shouldn't start by sleeping with all her friends
I didn't hate this movie The first one was far worse -- mercifully the cast and director have all been replaced
Proving the theorem from Todd Solondz's Palindromes that different actors can play the same role without losing much continuity Samantha Mathis plays Dagny with all the lifelessness Taylor Schilling brought to the original role
The people behind the Atlas Shrugged series of films have things they want to tell you and just to make sure that you know what they are the movies tell you and tell you and then tell you again
New viewers aren't expected to jump into the dense story now and anyone coming back for seconds is predisposed to believing this is the most important movie of the year Sean Hannity or another right-wing mouthpiece told them so
If the novel Atlas Shrugged is ultimate libertarian porn then the first two installments of the screen adaptation are soggy softcore
A disaster as a film Atlas also is laughable in its presentation of Rand's ideology
It's consistent with its predecessor as a somewhat awkward translation of Ayn Rand's  novel to our current era handled with bland telepic-style competency
The portrait of American gloom and doom has its layers of meanings and philosophies but I'd rather approach Atlas as a clumsy B-movie with occasional entertainment value
The producers are going to have to hire a better director if they want moviegoers to be curious enough about this Galt guy to buy a ticket for the presumptive third and final chapter
Director John Putch struggles to find balance or generate a single spark from the clunky mix of romance political diatribe and thriller
Seriously if this is the best promotion of itself that the free market can manage it really would benefit from the help of a Ministry of Culture or something
It's still kinda bad but at least this movie won't be an industry punchline for years to come  Oh what a difference competence makes
A niche movie on a par with any cheapjack faith-based picture which is why it resembles one -- and only the most ardently faithful need apply
Rand's detractors will hate the movie as much as they do her but her fans will be satisfied
Atlas won't be the only one to shrug off this tiresome load
The film's excruciating unwatchability transcends politics
The acting is better than in Part  but the fact this is the middle segment leaves the audience that might like it dissatisfied
The Bad Boys II of ty propaganda films morally and aesthetically corrupt yet compulsively watchable in the broad strokes Somewhere in heaven Eisenstein is laughing Hard
There are ironic footnotes in cinema history because they champion the free market yet fail miserably in it
A greedy billionaire's most feverish nightmare realized with all the amateurish panache of a daytime soap opera
Films aimed at families usually plant some jokes to ensure accompanying adults aren't bored witless by an endless stream of goofy gags but Horrid Henry The Movie flies defiantly against this trend
This is complete agony to sit through and with a lead character as snotty and unlikeable as Henry it's one to steer clear of
Over-indulgent children's comedy that's let down by a sloppy script patchy direction and some poor performances though it does have the occasional moment and its target audience will probably enjoy it
There's not much for mums and dads - this doesn't attempt any cute Pixar-style adult-pitched gags - but younger audiences will revel in the mischievous manipulations of a negative role model
Not quite Horrid but this Henry comes close Accompanying adults may wish they'd opted for triple detention
Shrill over-eager and frankly disappointing
I hate to say it but Hollywood did it better with Diary of a Wimpy Kid
A wasted opportunity
Three decades fewer on the clock would doubtless lighten my perspective but the slapstick here seems gauche while the script fails to provide the game young cast with much in the way of character or comedy
Oh dear oh dear Rarely has a film title been more fitting than this disappointing cinematic outing based on the mischievous character created by author Francesca Simon
Unutterably feeble-minded and unfunny
Ought to be better than it is
It's a cheap cheerless and laugh-free disaster zone with a woeful script and the sort of performances you'd be disappointed to see in a school play In a wordhorrid
The action is shot in fits and starts with silly songs trying to camouflage the lack of a serviceable script School of Rock it's not
Kids will enjoy the gobby tween attitude and energy but the paper-thin plot and extraneous D antics don't provide the solid laughs of say Diary Of A Wimpy Kid
A broad noisy comedy based on a series of popular books and TV films about a rebellious primary-school boy in revolt against his family school and all things genteel
It is incredibly noisy messy completely exhausting and feels as if it is never going to end
Filmed in eye-popping cartoony colours and with eye-popping cartoony acting to match the kids mug enthusiastically in school nativity play fashion amid fidgety hyper-active camerawork that suggests the director has eaten too many blue Smarties
The bogeys and slime are deployed with a wild enthusiasm that doesn't transpire into the diabolically lacking script
Forgettable British kid comedy is pretty horrid indeed
I would rather go to Hell than sit through that movie again
This mess makes no sense and plods along for  minutes throwing things at us that are neither scary nor contributing to the tale
More of the same on a cut-rate budget without Gans's atmospheric reverie
The only solace is that there is no direct threat of a sequel
The random hectic storyline has little rhyme or reason the unimaginative D feels like a rip-off and only Clemens seems to be taking this seriously
I realize it's called Silent Hill for a reason but enduring this botched video game-based nightmare is like sleepwalking into the world's dullest Halloween party
Come to Silent Hill reads a scary message left for teen damsel Heather Hell no
A sacrilegious adaptation of an excellent video game Silent Hill Revelation will infuriate gamers and just confuse everyone else
Can't even offer up the flashy production design that aficionados of the game liked about the Christophe Gans-directed original
While Silent Hill Revelation D may not allay your hankering for a solid story it'll definitely satisfy your blood-lust
With Bean unable to save the unsavable we're left with waves of hard-working special effects trying to torture Heather instead of being able to enjoy a top star on form
It's in too much of a rush and tries to cram in so much plot that unless you're familiar with the game it's closely adapted from chances are it will leave you baffled
saturated with over-the-top sound effects Did nobody realise that it's called Silent Hill
It's like going through a cheesy house of horrors at the local carnival You want it to end but not because it's scary
I can't imagine anyone who hasn't played the video game who would give a shout-out to the 'Silent Hill' sequel
Put this much effort into bringing your idea of Hell to the screen film fans will start calling you Satan And not in a good way
Just how terrible is SHD Well at one point writer-director Michael J Bassett actually tries to scare you with a Kellogg's Frosted Pop-Tart No kidding
There has to be someone out there who can make a successful video-game adaptation because faith is being lost year after year and Silent Hill Revelation does nothing for the many unwavering believers
The demon-haunted West Virginia town still gives the creeps but this belated sequel proves to be only fitfully exciting and scary - mostly because the action stops every few minutes for yet another character to deliver reams of boring exposition
It manages to not only contort itself into a form that is simultaneously convoluted and stupid but it also skilfully avoids any audience engagement despite a tumultuous whirl of spectacle and noise
This irredeemably silly tropical screwball comedy made in  is only now getting a release-and that's no surprise
The charisma and comic timing of the film's female leads make up for some of the screenwriting rough patches but not enough to justify a trip to the theater
It's refreshing for critics when movies like You May Not Kiss the Bride come along We don't get to use words like insipid nearly enough
A noisy unlikable distraction that seems more invested in photographing lush Hawaiian locations than solidifying a sense of humor that might coexist peacefully with the violence
Surely some Hollywood studio in the s made a prototype of the sprightly if erratic comedy You May Not Kiss the Bride
The plotting just ends up feeling like a lot of business ideas meant to keep the characters busy and in motion rather than actually reflecting anything like human behavior
Its lunacy is well staged and fast-paced Too bad the movie's premise is so lame that the nimbler moments can't redeem it
The low-brow script leads the characters through one far-fetched scenario after another with few laughs along the way But at least the scenery is nice
A movie that never figures out a way to stitch together all of its incongruous elements
That the movie is slated for a straight-to-DVD release in the US next year is probably indicative of its cinematic potential It all feels a little bit sitcommy
Cyrus seems to be playing dress-up when she dons the biker gear that is supposedly her second skin Not-especially-high high jinks ensue
Its target audience will lap it upbut the rest of us will be searching for deep cover
You know something really bad has happened when the FBI are forced to call in Miley Cyrus
As Miley Cyrus vehicles go this is entirely watchable fluff enlivened by likeable performances and some decent one-liners
Kelly Osbourne's peculiar turn as her sassy roommate doesn't up the fizz
Cyrus seems bored as if ready to jump ship to another movie
Like whatever
A turkey that may serve a useful function in being the last nail in the coffin of Miley Cyrus's acting career
So Undercover has a by-the-numbers script which cannibalises most of its ideas from other American college campus films
There's no sign as yet that the perky but otherwise unremarkable Ms Cyrus is going to find it easy graduating from teen star to grown-up actress
The plotting is confused perfunctory and for much of the way ignored
A more convincing star could have saved this although to be fair to Cyrus she hasn't much to work with
Endeavoring to reveal more sides to Cyrus as she moves over to twentysomething pursuits So Undercover isn't ambitious and brave enough to truly shake up her career in new and exciting ways
Miley Cyrus stars in this forgettable dud of a campus comedy
To keep up her cover Miley Cyrus's private eye has to spout nonsense like 'Totes' and 'Amazeballs' while pretending to be an empty-headed ditz when the story finally gets wrapped up 'Amazeballs' will not be the word that comes to your lips
positions itself as a mindless series of shootouts and chase sequences
Defined by needless frenetic exertion in lieu of anything resembling inspiration
A catastrophe worth noting only for the presence of its name cast
The Cold Light of Day is a colossal mess -- and amazingly dumb
If you are a Willis or Weaver completist then just wait until cable for this lifeless and uninspired waste
Charging  for this movie is criminal vouchers and letters of apology should be handed out at the exit for those stalwart viewers who stick it out to the end
Rather than defining those twists and turns with sharp punctuation director Mabrouk El Mechri turns them into gentle speed bumps making the film barely interesting rather than exhilarating
The script throws around phrases like intel terrorist and rogue operative but as time bombs go the briefcase-versus-loved-ones ultimatum barely ticks
A perfunctory chase movie that drops in its tracks long before it reaches what's supposed to pass for a rousing climax
Weaver is the only one having any fun - and that includes the audience
If you were to look up the word generic in the dictionary you'd see a picture of this film's poster right next to it
An average suspense thriller made a little better by a no holds barred performance from Sigourney Weaver
The Cold Light of Day is an appropriately named action drama It generates very little heat or light
Fans of inane andor unnecessary expositional dialogue will have a field day Everyone else can Netflix Hudson Hawk and forget to watch it thus having more fun than anyone who shells out  for this tedious stinker
Cavill is no substitute for Van Damme whose self-critical performance gave the earlier movie much of its heft
Sigourney Weaver who last year suffered the indignity of backing up Taylor Lautner -- Taylor Lautner for God's sake -- in the daft Abduction now finds herself essaying the role of the villain in another action flick that's nearly as dopey
the kind of shoddy low-rent stinker the robots on Mystery Science Theater  used to enjoy ripping to shreds
An unnecessary but inoffensive espionage thriller that you have to assume was an inch away from going straight to DVD
A poorly-directly and terribly-executed mess of a motion picture that should have been left in the dark
One of those lousy multinational productions usually cobbled together from some Israeli dry-cleaner's fun-money hoping for a quick buck on the direct-to-video circuit
Any true emotions are snuffed out by over-the-top shock humor that though constantly ratcheted up is only done so to conceal the film's tonal inconsistencies and unease when it comes to big questions
As it is Nature Calls is a frequently funny mess but a mess all the same
Overall this is one comedy I hope never makes it to theaters Ok it's a step or two above Bucky Larson but it's not worth the price of admission
As capably as the plot comes together the big laughs hardly come
Writer-director Todd Rohal fills muddled scenes with manic amounts of jokes that all manage to land with a thud
There's nothing wrong with slack misanthropy but as piss-takes go Nature Calls offers a pretty thin stream
The unmitigated disaster of the camping trip just stays disastrous the story never really finding its way from adversity to heroic redemption
The humor in Nature Calls tends toward the dopey and obvious
Nature Calls is something else for sure but falls short of fitting into the wild and weird cinematic world Rohal has created
After a lot of wandering around we realize we've really just been walking in circles the whole time
I'd write that it's the worst thing to happen to the Boy Scouts in quite some time but the organization appears to have bigger fish to fry these days
Its jokes won't appeal to anyone older than  but a parent who takes a child to this crass mess would be subject to prosecution
It almost seems like harder work somehow to get this many comedians together and then turn out a movie that is only so fitfully funny
A low-watt low-wit comedy
It's probably best to let this particular call from nature go unheeded
Nature Calls promises a silly good time only to display little interest in fulfilling that promise
squanders its cast amid a collection of lackluster gags
Forgettable raunchy scouting comedy isn't for young kids
More Hangover than Moonrise Kingdom but with elements of both And more than a few rude and raunchy laughs
Nature Calls eventually becomes something of an ordeal to sit through
Its ambition is decimated by its absurdly slapdash assembly and fogged messages on the zombification of consumerism
It's not every day you see an ostensible satire that's never funny on purpose but is frequently hilarious by accident
The worst of the worst but serious connoisseurs of le bad cinema shouldn't pass it up
This fantastical fable takes aim at marketing itself with an intriguing if tendentious narrative
This movie makes absolutely no sense
To borrow a hamburger chain's refrain not lovin' it
There's almost a Seussian vibe in this heap but no hint that it's intentional
Nothing more than a freshman's first term paper for a sociology
Satire usually implies at least a little bit of humor and Branded is mostly humorless -- if it was ever actually trying to be funny then it fails If a satire should be pointed then this movie is more on the dull side
Branded is a confusing sci-fi thriller that takes itself much too seriously
Never boring but never as engaging as it could or should be
Pollyanna does 'Frisco
The lack of plausible conflict mars the movie's highly commendable depiction of San Francisco as a the new porn capital
About Cherry only manages to seem inconsequential
It's pornography bathed in the tangerine glow of fruit-scented candlelight
It has a didactic undercurrent making its main character into a beautiful blank ready to blossom under the bright camera lights and to be unabashed in the face of the unenlightened
A muddled inconsequential journey of a surprisingly unsympathetic character and her hazy ride to the top of the porno food chain
Everything here is done badly
The fatal flaw  is its refusal to examine Angelina's occupation from outside the bubble You might even call it a recruitment film
This is just a slow-moving skin flick broken up by lots of boring discussions about Cherry's future
Despite Hinshaw's audacious performance the characters remain at an emotional distance
Mediocre drama centered a young woman's introduction to the porn industry
Flimsy and fetishized it delivers little more than a hackneyed skin flick
Here is a movie that suggests prostitution is something that just sort of happens to you like Lyme disease
Generates a sensual world existing on top of the real one where many people work non-ideal jobs simply to pay the bills
Dramas about the porn industry range from expressions of puritanical rage to celebrations of open sexuality this one manages to avoid both extremes as well as anything else that might make it worth watching
So much of About Cherry is meant to titillate and dramatize but never humanize
Rather shockingly lacking in dynamic plotting the film descends into mystifying incomprehensibility in its final reels showing a lack of understanding of basic human motivations
almost laughably unsexy
When a guilty perv is all a film has to offer by way of a protagonist then it's probably in the best interests of us all if it doesn't exist
Filled with flawed ideas subtle bigotry and amateurish technique Last Ounce of Courage tested my last ounce of patience
This is bigotry masquerading as leadership thuggery claiming the banner of freedom braggadocio pretending to be strength
A good reminder that storytelling clichs and inattention to narrative detail can detract from a movie's message
Bookended by a pair of Ronald Reagan quotes Last Ounce of Courage is pure preaching-to-the-choir poppycock
The problem with this numbskull travesty isn't that it's fatuous and smug which it is It's that it's slack and dull
The patriot-packaged Last Ounce of Courage has been made with the conviction of true zealots but also the competence of amateurs
The sheer volume of what I like to call eyebrow acting -- in which thespian intensity is directly proportional to the angle and depth of one's forehead furrows -- is staggering
sort of a Red Dawn for those who believe that Christmas is under assault by secular forces It is the very first movie that comes with The Chuck Norris Seal of Approval
It's a bait-and-switch that masquerades as inspirational drama while pushing a political agenda
Politics aside the hamfisted melodrama amateurish acting a tasteless finale and a cameo by either God or a ZZ Top cover-band refugee make Last Ounce of Courage laughably awful
America-- This
It's a call for the faithful to rise up if they or any heathens who stumble in the audience can wake from their naps or their fits of helpless unintentional laughter
A Christian themed movie that needs better acting and definitely a better script
It takes the joy of Christmas and makes it bellicose I'd rather have a black licorice candy cane thanks
This religious-themed drama about a small-town mayor's personal crusade against the war on Christmas is about as subtle as the character's name -- Bob Revere
Doesn't offer anything new let alone entertaining
The whole ordeal only lasts  minutes but that's still too long for a film with no ambition aside from lightening your wallet
Plants wither and furniture is rearranged as if the demon were an inconsiderate housesitter
When you look into this abyss it yawns back at you
This horror movie from Warner Bros is nothing special but it's nice to see a modest genre entertainment buoyed by a major studio's resources
Todd Lincoln in his directorial debut shows the restraint of a young Val Lewton Things go bad oh-so-slowly
Every fo paux The Apparition commits stems from a general atmosphere lacking any vibrant heartbeat creating characters and conflicts which are tragically birthed on life support
The Apparition is a rare example of filmmaking failure that is so complete it will exacerbate its audience in nearly every way possible
A thinly sketched paranormal thriller stripped almost bare of anything that might provide some color complication or personality
I like a good ghost story but 'The Apparition' is nothing like a good ghost story It's more like a Syfy Channel show where they try to scare people in a darkened room
When I finally get around to writing a textbook this is going to be one of my primary examples of how not to make a horror movie
The apparition because it's lame spends a lot of its time tying clothes into knots moving dressers and opening doors
This new supernatural thriller by first-time director Todd Lincoln has stinker written all over it In indelible ink
a softball horror film made for -year-old girls at a slumber party wanting to be sort of scared
From start to finish the movie basks in horrible horror clichs that will leave viewers straining to find something original in the proceedings
Dull dreary pointless and bad sporting shock scenes that don't shock a grisly premise that doesn't make sense and a meager cast of mostly uninterested-looking Hollywood lookers
It's frightening to think that a major studio like Warner Brothers would not only release a film this bad into theaters nationwide but that it would even green light it in the first place
None of this matters at all because the main characters are completely unlikable and the momentum is consistently ruined by poor decision-making
In so many ways a missed opportunity The Apparition looked like it could conjure a few scares in telling the story of a couple haunted by an entity they helped release but this Ashley Greene vehicle fades into the void with a yawn
Devoid of scares and energy the picture is all bumps in the night and has nothing to set it apart from its other forgettable post-Japanese horror contemporaries
Spends much of its run time in neutral with actors either unprepared for the demands of the subgenre or locked in paycheck mode stiffly working through tepid dialogue tedious procedural events and dull romantic yearnings
DVD Review I can't fully recommend it but if all you're looking for is a cheesy action film for a rainy evening you could do far worse than this
Oh Josh Duhamel - is there nothing you can do
Violent obnoxious and forgettable Fire With Fire is an action shambles with some hilariously literal plotting
Avoid like the plague The nasty Bubonic kind
David Barrett's daft generic revenger barrels along nicely often nastily enough but it must have missed going straight to DVD by a whisker
You need to see this like we need another closeup of a hole in the head
Duhamel makes a perfect fireman because he's such a charisma vacuum he could suck the oxygen out of any blaze
Your hard-earned cash deserves to be spent on something which at the very least attempts to engage the viewer on some level
It looks like a dozen others of its kind and hasn't a smidgeon of distinction about it anywhere except that Willis has given up his various wigs and thus looks more like his true grizzled self
Although it's probably the biggest movie yet to emerge from rapper  Cent's production outfit this damp squib still has straight to DVD stamped all over it
The result is breathtakingly dumb with absolutely zero redeeming features
If action B-movies are your thing then this is just about worth searching out
Josh Duhamel fails to set the screen ablaze as a California firefighter who becomes an unlikely vigilante avenger in this very routine action thriller but he gets no help from a damp squib of a script
A smutty display of wall-to-wall couplings and triplings with a patina of class as thin as a see-through negligee
A highly schematic film about how the members of a family each revel in their own sexuality there's a nice healthy glow here apparently meant to substitute for story
Most of the camera time goes to airy awkward sex no genitalia though plenty of breasts and backsides and while it's never titillating it's also never involving
Its scope is too limited for it to muster much of a response in us beyond basic titillation And there are plenty of better places to go for that
You'll have more fun staying at home
while it may cover a range of thorny issues surrounding crime and punishment few would accuse this film of subtlety from its tell-you-how-to-feel soundtrack to its in-your-face editing
A sick abomination an excuse to squeeze in an hour of torture between eighteen minutes of melodrama and schlock
a passable horror effort that remains a marginal cut above its direct-to-video brethren
a film more suited to the bottom shelf of the DVD rental store not the multiplex
A serviceable genre entry that is admittedly destined to leave non-horror fans absolutely cold
No amount of plucked-off fingernails are going to fill this empty vessel with any semblance of a point
It's an angry picture but that dependable sense of rage doesn't carry through to the end Instead the effort dissolves into a strange genre predictability
Robert Lieberman's Perverted Justice advert spins its wheels with scene after scene impatiently cut like a montage sequence
Lean nasty and patently absurd The Tortured plays like one long scream of agony
The flick gets off on surgical slicings and an overall Fincheresque gloominess the latter becoming an unwitting joke
The torture-porn label would stick if wasn't so hard to imagine anyone getting much out of it
It's a revolting horror film that wastes the talents and good looks of Erika Christensen and Jesse Metcalfe in favor of severed penises and other violent atrocities performed on a kitchen table
Ugh
It suggests only that ferreting out new ways to inflict pain requires more imagination than anyone on hand realized
Its clichs grow slightly funny But not funny enough to make the endless torture scenes bearable
The title is an apropos description of audiences who sit through this inept low-budget psychological thriller which would be considered tasteless if it weren't so incompetent
A stupendously inane and pointless slice of revenge-based horror whose title might as well describe the audience watching it
Under the circumstances even first-rate New York stage actors like Thomas Sadoski and Justin Kirk seem uncertain and tentative
A heat wave draws a group of New Yorkers into a ring of seduction and desire in this shoddy exercise marked by posturing and pretention
The jazz-scored pic relies heavily on quirkiness to round out shaky characterizations and inject interest into otherwise forgettable pairings
Unfortunately the filmmaker mistakes inertia for sensuality keeping the material in a frustrating state of paralysis
While it lends itself to some interesting insight on the politics of non-exclusive -buddy dynamics its characters are ultimately too one-dimensional and their dialogue too theatrical to sustain an involving cinematic experience
Where the original play La Ronde was a social satire about the transmission of venereal disease  Beats is a sickly stepchild
It means to be an interconnected story in which one coupling leads to another in increasingly ridiculous fashion until you're not only no longer interested you're grinding your teeth hoping it will end
This wisp of a movie inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's play La Ronde offers only hints of the complicated personalities behind the characters' sleek well-toned surfaces
Beats goes on to a meandering orgasm of multiple less-than-dangerous liaisons meant to titillate fascinate and illuminate But once the sweat dries it irritates
That's all that happens drift from one unrealized uninteresting character to another
Despite the presence of such actors as Lee Pace Jennifer Tilly Justin Kirk Thomas Sadoski and Paz de la Huerta there is no character insight allowed by the bumper-car storytelling
In  Beats the conversational foreplay is hopelessly flaccid
The actors barely seem to dip their toes into these scenes even when they're involved in a mnage a trois or an elaborate bondage scheme
This umpteenth variation on Schnitzler's classic play La Ronde fails to arouse
VIDEO ESSAY Marginally enhanced by the presence of a few experienced actors Jennifer Tilly Paz De La Huerta Lee Pace writer-director Alexis Lloyd's Manhattan-set sexual roundelay is a shoddy feature debut
A clever storytelling structure can easily be reduced to a mere gimmick when there's no story of worth to tell
A sexy smart and sophisticated exploration of sex love and everything in between
The characters are props in what's essentially a lame screenwriting exercise
As an experiment  Beats is an uneven if not entirely uninteresting failure In its attempt to be modern and titillating it actually distances and confounds
A date movie for narcoleptics
The tepid indie feelgood romcom follows a too familiar formulaic storyline to hold my interest
The film in its defense is far too vacuous to be accused of having any kind of agenda-it just happens to get its politics wrong along with everything else
Takes a frenzied late turn into espionage territory an attempt to gather momentum that only makes the film more tiresome
Clumsy awkward unfunny indie rom-com about a grad-student scientist trying to quantify whether or not she's really in love
If you want to enjoy watching a confused scientist grappling with life choices stick with The Nutty Professor
Science-themed rom-com isn't ready for clinical trials
While Losing Control is a thoroughly likable playful comedy there's never a sense that writer-director Valerie Weiss is in total command of film's tone pacing or comic content which is considerable
Kent is the least credible scientist since Denise Richards donned short shorts to play Dr Christmas Jones
With its labored parade of polygamists neurotic Jewish parents and projectile semen explosions Control offers nothing new This one should have stayed in a test tube
Weiss's ideas about moviemaking storytelling and character development are indistinguishable from bargain-bin romantic comedies so-called chick flicks and television shows that barely last a season
The tone and pacing and even the characters are inconsistent but still writerdirector Valerie Weiss gives the film some wit some humorous situations and a refreshing dash of real science
Losing Control a film experiment gone wrong
Perhaps investigating something new would have better served Weiss than simply looking to her own experiences exploring rather than settling
Losing Control nicely mixes comedic absurdity with weightier career vs commitment themes
With its hackneyed outlook and lack of a moral core or a purpose 'General Education' is little more than a defective episode of 'Saved by the Bell'
Too derivative to be amusing and too earnest to be parodic it assumes the form of countless other teen comedies minus any wit or drama
When the biggest name in the movie is Janeane Garofalo why waste her in an extraneous laugh-free side role as the protagonist's neglected housewife mother
As generic and forgettable as its title this half-hearted attempt at a teen comedy feels like a term paper you might buy online poorly written and cribbed from a million other sources
Unfortunately in General Education even tried-and-true formulas fall flat thanks to the lack of several key elements-good dialogue fully developed characters and a satisfying story
The lead character's sister is more interesting than he is and she spends much of her screen time as a mute mime
Wavers between extreme silliness and unbearable earnestness
Plays out in a bland sitcom way but is mercifully peppered with a few bizarre moments of surreal slapstick that keep it afloat
The film is like a new colt tripping over itself going off every which way
The film feels like a strained collection of outtakes from other comedies about teenage nerds and dysfunctional families
A technically impressive tapioca of a movie this bland indie seriocomedy may serve as an early springboard for a couple of talented young actors but little else
Defiantly humorless the comedy is little more than a grab-bag of familiar high school-film cliches populated with bland characters played by barely-there actors It was clearly a labor of love for no one
If given the choice between going to class and seeing the high-school comedy General Education go with school
What have I learned High school movies can be dullerand more sourthan previously thought possibleThe least generic element of General Education is its openly hostile attitude toward gay people Blu-ray
What screenwriters Tom Morris Elliot Feld and Jaz Kalkat fail to build is dramatic tension affable extremely self-involved Levi easily skates around all obstacles
It nearly perfects the concept of an idiot plot
Every so often a movie comes along that's so lame you can almost make out a What the hell am I doing here thought bubble over an actor's head
When a movie resorts to scenes of a grown man rolling around on a floor slick with spilled semen samples something plainly has gone wrong
Mostly The Babymakers coasts lazily along on the likability of the cast and the occasional amusing moment
The Babymakers is amazing in its complete lack of comedy nearly satirical in its rejection of levity and full-on embrace of mediocrity
Crude mostly unimaginative comedy is meant for adults
'The Babymakers' is so uninspired it's depressing
The only moments where The Babymakers provides any kind of comic lift come when talented improvisers like Faxon Heffernan Chandrasekhar and Aisha Tyler clearly go off-book and noodle their way into something that's actually amusing
The sole function served by this motion picture is to illustrate how not to frame jokes in movies
Preposterous inane and silly but outrageously funny
In short the movie's not funny enough or serious-minded enough to warrant  minutes of your time
A film of limited effort slowly sealing off its potential the longer it lingers on lackluster comedy in a manner that's become habitual to Chandrasekhar and his cronies
Made me laugh made me care and didn't insult my intelligence It's almost as fun as making a baby yourself
The plot is content to stay at surface level never truly working for big laughs when easy ones can be grasped instead
It actually gets more stupid the more you think about it
Some funny moments but not many despite decent playing from Mann and Schneider
A romcom that fumbles for heart in the gutter and finds only glib gags
What starts as an insightful bracingly straight-spoken comedy about infertility falls apart in the final act when it diverts into a wacky under-developed adventure
The screenwriters started with a great premise and then ran out of ideas abandoning the more risky inventive procreation comedy for corny slapstick
Wants to appeal to the fan base of Broken Lizard desperately but also wants to service the audience that loves movies from Garry Marshall or Rob Reiner
We are knee-deep in the lazy side of the found footage pool
Adheres strictly to ghost story clichs
Trying to overthink a ghost story Apartment  goes from appealing to ridiculous in a hurry saved slightly by a handful of good frights
The MPAA rating more than sums up the movie Rated R for language and some terror Not enough terror in my book
One of the more disposable found-footage efforts as of late
It doesn't take long to gather the influences trickling through Derick Martini's Hick an aimless tumbleweed of a road movie if ever there was one
The movie careers downhill with the speed of an unhinged kangaroo with one foot
In the end the story's potential emotional complexity - the idea that we might want to protect a young character while also recognizing her waiting-in-the-wings sexuality - ends up in a bland gray area
Doesn't deserve to be remembered as much of anything
Forced irony or klutziness Too often that's the question you ask of Hick which makes the answer all too clear
Mostly plays like some creepy-perv fantasia looking for mileage from the mature-beyond-her-years presence of young star Chlo Grace Moretz
A smarmy little road movie about a Southern teenage girl losing her innocence the hard way during the Reagan era
Hick was intended to be a calling card for all parties involved to point at as evidence of their talent and bravery instead it's a black blot of shame for everyone who had a part in its making
Runaway teen faces violence harsh reality in mature drama
Hick wants to come across as trippy and offbeat but its bizarre surreal approach is more off-putting than effective
shows that the era of the redneck road flick isn't over but by God should be
Director Derick Martini basically gives up on storytelling about  minutes into the feature hoping a grubby atmosphere of creepy men and vulnerable women is enough to patch the abyssal holes in the plot
Though Hick promises danger sex or at least sexiness and adventure it delivers a dry tale lacking in real action or intensity
It contains some effective performances it does a good job of evoking bereft and empty landscapes but what is it for Has she learned anything Have we
Recognizes that kids can't expect the grass to be greener but comes too close to suggesting that you can expect others to mow your lawn
Ambles back and forth between tomfoolery and strained seriousness
And so it came to Chlo Grace Moretz as it must to all child actors puberty
Hick is worth the effort -- and it does have some genuinely witty writing
Just a notch above dismal Even with the star power
Derek Martini's second feature - after the competent Lymelife - is a confused mess of awkward tonal shifts and boring narrative tangents all encased in the discomforting shell of a Lolita fantasy
Trade of Innocents is as much a piece of social-justice campaigning as it is a work unto itself an important fact to remember when considering its many flaws
Not for the first time in films noble intent is at odds with aesthetics
Yes child trafficking is horrific but embedding your raise-the-alarm mission in a film this inept runs the risk of arousing more amusement than activism
The movie screams of a low budget and pedestrian vision
The film fills up its hour-and-a-half harmlessly enough but nothing's really memorable Which is rather bitterly ironic
A message movie whose only subtlety is found in the portrayal of Adderly a sexual predator who actually believes in some twisted way that he loves the children whose childhoods he's destroys
A middling thriller wrapped around a compelling lecture about the child sex trade in Southeast Asia
ATM isn't a convincing movie but the production is at least breaking a sweat on this effort making it a promising misfire that might enchant those on the hunt for something slightly cockeyed when it comes to the torment of innocents
If both good and evil characters don't behave in ways that make sense vis--vis their circumstances any sense of terror quickly dissipates
After memorably sealing Ryan Reynolds in a coffin in Buried screenwriter Chris Sparling's attempts to make a two-ATM vestibule equally claustrophobic are less inspired
Perfunctory killings outside bickering ninnies inside It's about as riveting as it sounds
While ATM does offer a few jolts we're paired with bland characters and an underrealized premise
Even by the most lenient of genre standards the behavior of the characters in David Brooks's ATM is ludicrous enough to make anyone grind his or her teeth in frustration
Screenwriter Chris Sparling worked in confined spaces to far better effect before with the minimalist Ryan Reynolds thrillerBuried He must have used his best ideas there
Mr Brooks capitalizes on antiseptic fluorescent interiors while the score by David Buckley nicely accents stress points
Not much about the movie makes sense though there are occasional schlocky thrills
None of it builds to anything or engenders any real suspense
a vaguely interesting idea for a scary movie made dull and derivative
This ATM-set horror film fails to dispense sufficient thrills
It would probably work better as a parody The laughs are already built-in
A new thriller with three talented actors nonetheless caught in an ineffective film that stretches to meet its running time and then ends with a final act that destroys suspension of disbelief
resorts to incoherent contrivances involving characters who lack basic common sense
Spatially contained thriller ATM squanders the efforts of a solid young cast fumbling away viewer sympathy via increasingly harebrained scenarios Audiences will feel as ripped off as they would be by exorbitant user fees at the namesake devices
An increasingly ludicrous thriller
Even at the script stage someone ought to have noticed how many holes were present in this story
ATM's flawed premise leads to a film that lacks the necessary tension and character development to keep the audience engaged in the story Furthermore the characters' unwillingness to act on their situation merely makes for a very frustrating film
Lots of silliness a few nasty kills and a cool third act
As the actors ham it up we're surprised how involved we get in their increasingly ridiculous story
Fans of How to Train Your Dragon will certainly be disappointed much like everyone else
When the dystopian future envisioned in Blade Runner finally comes to fruition Age of the Dragons will be used to distinguish humans from replicants because if you're not in teary despair by the film's end you probably aren't human
Entirely forgettable and somewhat unhealthy lingering on the palate like an impulsive Friday-night kebab
Sadly any car-crash appeal is undercut by the cardinal B-movie sin dullness
Dreadful Moby Dick adaptation that squanders its perfectly decent set-up and is further let down by a terrible script atrocious acting poor action sequences and some extremely dodgy special effects
There is some truth in advertising - Age Of The Dragons does drag on for an age
Like a harpoon in the side of Herman Melville's great novel this low budget fantasy yarn is more drag than dragon
Might have worked in the hands of Roger Corman and John Sayles
Herman Melville's Moby-Dick gets a landlocked remix courtesy of ill-conceived action-adventure Age of the Dragons
Watch the opening sequence skip everything that else that follows
The acting is the strong suit of this 'cold case civil rights murder' drama with songwriter JD Souther -- who resembles a more professorial Clint Eastwood -- making a particularly distinct impression
By the end of it you'll be crying uncle--or wish you were watching The Help instead At least that was a more artful lie
The fact that real-life deadly racial animus in America is often cartoonish in its manifestation doesn't excuse Deadline's clich-ridden characterizations of bigotry
Although helmer Curt Hahn champions the causes of racial justice and crusading journalism he can't seem to find a tone that's consistent or that befits the gravity of his subject matter
The plot in short is underwhelming It merely follows the reporters as the screenplay serves them the solution to their case on a silver platter
Too lifeless for Lifetime and too inept to do justice to its source material
Has all the dramatic punch of a community theater production
A case involving the murder of a black youth gets solved here but absolutely nothing could help this numbingly awful undoubtedly well-intentioned but who-cares-it's-so-bad farrago
it's not evil and it's enjoyable in the same way the really terrible movies featured on Mystery Science Theater  were enjoyable or at least it was for me and my jaded sensibilities a well-intentioned mess
It suffers from being too broad
Makes The Adventures of Pluto Nash look like Beverly Hills Cop
While not descending to the level of Murphy's worst work--'Pluto Nash' still stands unchallenged--it's a bland negligible example of the 'becoming a better person through magic' scenario
Sometimes it's hard to tell quite where the incisions start and stop throughout this already uneven creation
It isn't a horrible movie at least not in comparison to Norbit from the same star and director but it is a dispiritingly dull and cynical one
Not the worst Eddie Murphy movie but certainly not his best either
A Thousand Words ends up incomplete and disingenuous and worse not a frame of it is funny
Maybe Murphy should give future scripts a less cursory perusal
This lame wannabe comedy is an unmitigated disaster
The idea of Murphy that famously motormouthed actor suddenly tongue-tied is not a punchy enough punch line to carry a whole film
There is something almost poignant in the way Eddie Murphy so palpably desires to make a meaningful film about enlightenment The almost comes from the difference between that aspiration and the painfully ill-conceived follow-through
Like a bad penny Eddie Murphy is back again in a family-friendly PG- comedy that nobody wants to see
equal parts labored allegory without resonance and forced comedy without laughs
Murphy without the words to go along with his bug-eyed double-takes and the mugging is lost here He's never been a silent comic and never will be
Hopelessly underwhelming from start to finish
The sort of awful formulaic crud that  Rock brilliantly mocked just before Leap Day
'A Thousand Words' is not unspeakably awful
You've got one of the funniest verbal actors in the business in Eddie Murphy and you put him in a movie where he can't talk It's already a recipe for disaster
a poorly conceived and startlingly miscast comedy that works to every one of its stars' weaknesses
A thousand words Try two words stay away Murphy does a pretty good job keeping up with the various indignities heaped on him but the movie as a whole ends up sinking
A moment of silence please for Kate Hudson's career
The film reaches into the pits of moviegoing hell when it finds Marley on a celestial white couch ringed in billowing white curtains communing with God And God is embodied by Whoopi Goldberg
Who's got time for bed-rest when there are hang-gliding lessons to be had
A cringe-inducing romantic comedy turned cancer tragedy turned inspirational hosanna about living in the moment embracing your bliss and other clichs
Gren Wells' screenplay throws around a few ideas about female independence and sexuality but finally it's as shallow as it is mawkish
In the long history of bad movies about bad illnesses A Little Bit of Heaven just might be the worst
Who knew dying could be such a laugh riot Certainly not any of us who have actually watched a loved one in the awful final stages of cancer
This movie turns into a total bummerfest that isn't sad enough to make me cry or funny enough to make me giggle
When a movie opens with a character telling you that love isn't important that movie is definitely going to smack down that nonbeliever because movies always believe love is important
Kate Hudson dies prettily in this tone-deaf dramedy about a woman finding love while suffering from colon cancer
In A Little Bit of Heaven Hudson pushes the Just Die Already meter straight into the red
Although New Orleans sparkles as the film's setting the story boasts too many moving and mismatched parts to resonate in any sort of meaningful way
It's hard to develop much empathy for the characters in the final reel when everything leading to that point rings so emotionally false
A little bit of hell
An overdose of sentimentality that ends up being painful to watch
Bizarre combo of terminal cancer weepy and sexy romcom
Sap without the weight of reality awkwardly combined with a romance without much chemistry
For those who have a lot of time to waste
Director Nicole Kassell is completely out of her element here
While director Nicole Kassall tried to create an independent female lead who doesn't give into stereotypes with Marley the overall movie ultimately lacked originality a memorable story and characters with any true purpose
The less said about THAT ending the better But as a brief brutal and nasty vignette showing the naked weirdness of an authentic exorcism it's not sooo bad
at best a placeholder for better films and a reminder that gimmicks - be they technical or narrative - will get a filmmaker only so far
Some found footage should really just stay lost
If you are a novice this kind of material is suitably spooky To the veteran less so
Exorcism horror gets the clichd shaky-camera treatment in this chiller
The Devil Inside has the occasional creepy moment but it's let down by a patchy script and some uneven performances
Another abysmal horror movie based around found documentary footage
The Devil Inside is yet another dull found footage effort with nothing bar a mad climax to offer audiences
A run-of-the-mill exorcism movie hobbled by its own hype and a divisive ending
Just terrible
And in a wretched attempt to make this contrivance 'real' they resort to endless shaking of the camera You would love to shake them The only possession I was looking for in this devilish drivel was the possession of any kind of filmmaking talent
If it's January it must be low-grade horror season
Despite a clever - if not particularly original - idea this pseudo-documentary horror movie is let down by an immensely frustrating ending and some less than convincing performances
A terribly written dubious slice of unscary found footage spiritual horror that ends with an ellipsis not a period
Nothing more than a tired familiar and characterless genre installment with only the impressive contortions of Bonnie Morgan to recommend it
horror that tries to shock you as many times as possible rather than tell you a story
An exposition-heavy opening act and an abrupt lack of closure may leave moviegoers feeling underserved by The Devil Inside's few genuinely scary moments
The Devil Inside is a con job a fraud of a movie that leads audiences to the singularly most unsatisfying ending to a movie I've seen in my  years as a movie critic
A stupid boring and inane exorcise in bargain basement horror
One shudders to think of how many worthwhile horror films Paramount passed up to acquire this terribly drab junkpile
Another example of a so so movie standing in the shadow of an excellent book
There seem to be somewhere in the neighborhood of  Stephanie Plum novels by Janet Evanoich God save us if One for the Money catches on
Compared to someone like Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight Stephanie is a total drip who needs to get her head on straight before she picks up a weapon again
Someday to be used in film schools as a textbook example of how not to adapt a best-selling novel for the screen One for the Money is mis-cast mis-scripted and mis-directed in every category
If the filmmakers can't be bothered to believe in the real-world implications of its premise then why ever should we
a second-rate and consistently worthless Out of Sight knockoff
The supposedly feisty Plum keeps following the lead of the two hunky men in her life Scrape off the Elmore-Leonard-lite scuzz and this is just a retroinactive rom-com
Heigl's fine and there's some zingy dialogue but the violence jars with the comedy and despite being written and directed by women it still comes off as needlessly sexist
With yet another ho-hum run at the multiplexes Katherine Heigl's big-screen resum is fast looking like an insider's gag
Is there no stopping Katherine Heigl Please
As bland and flavourless as movies come Please God no Two For The Show
Director Julie Anne Robinson never finds a convincing tone and ruins everything with over-emphatic comedy reaction shots and a music track that keeps telling us how funny everything is it isn't
The film miscasts Heigl and doesn't do much good for Debbie Reynolds as Grandma either
Ultimately it's further proof that Katherine Heigl picks her projects by stapling all potential scripts to a wall and throwing a dart
Heigl deserves better than this
Apart from the three girls behind me constantly shifting their legs so that it made my otherwise empty row feel as if I was in an earthquake One For The Money is an utterly lifeless joyless experience
One For The Money is a paint-by-numbers chick-flick that'll make you laugh a few times but won't particularly enamour
Didn't Jennifer Aniston already do a bounty hunter movie Talk about sloppy seconds
Light and fluffy as a cupcake Katherine Heigl's many talents are truly wasted in this story based on the first of eighteen best-selling Stephanie Plum novels
One doesn't need to have any familiarity with the Stephanie Plum novel series to immediately hear and see what an ill fit Katherine Heigl is for the role
Nickels misses the mark with this design of voyeurism and possession unable to launch his idea with an inspiring sense of madness or even basic boogeyman clarity
Playback posits cinema as a conduit for Satanic evil but has nothing to say about the act of watching except that its uniform horridness functions as an unintentional commentary on enduring pitiful horror-movie conventions
On the bright side the movie gets less irritating with each passing murder
Playback takes a potentially intriguing concept and punctuates it with extreme gore rather than thrilling suspense
ambition alone can't make a good film and if those elements are poorly put together and not fully realized it can become less than the sum of its already tired parts
New Year's Eve is like Woody Allen lite for the masses    by never threatening to copy the smut of  or Bridesmaids it's a memory-stirring warm-hearted breath of fresh air Even at  minutes

Watching Robert De Niro put yet another nail in the coffin of his career is bad enough but et tu Michelle Pfeiffer
Much of it is dreck but the stories that work are charming and in a few select cases provide a sudden emotional wallop
No message no car chases and explosions no D - just relaxing entertainment
A joyless overstuffed confection that seems designed more to maximise product placement
Proves in its tiny way that no matter how bad the modern romantic comedy has already become there's still plenty of room for it to get worse
a nice box of holiday chocolates
Garry Marshall how could you You have made a mockery of a movie that bears the name of my birthday I take this as a personal affront
New Year's Eve is pretty much laugh-free trading on tired visual gags and some unbelievably cynical 'cutesy' scenes baby montage anyone for most of its humour

a sea of quickly put together cheesy romcom vignettes that fail to put across any kind of meaningful message
The cinematic equivalent of a piece of New York style cheesecake and about as artistically satisfying
a perfectly watchable and consistently hackneyed feel-good ensemble drama
Among the year's worst films The tragedy is funny the comedy is tragic and about its only saving grace is that it makes 's Valentines Day look almost passable
Your appreciation for the film may depend on your tolerance for sugar
Colossal waste of talent and time
The bland lead the bland through a sea of New Year's revelers
Offering up genuinely unlikable characters and terrible dialogue this comedy qualifies as one of the year's worst
It's like channel surfing when there's nothing on but crap
As dysfunctional movie families go the Rubins hardly linger in the memory
The film has its moments but the score is so achingly intrusive I felt I was suffering from Rubinoid arthritis
A contrived script and clunky direction undermine this British film which veers from silly comedy to harsh drama to dark tragedy
Rubins ultimately sinks beneath the weight of its own gubbins
Like a cheap uninspired ITV bank holiday drama in which a decent cast is left stranded by a lousy script and lifeless direction
It's a decent idea gone wrong for want of a better script and tighter direction
Give me an oy Give me a vey
There are some films so bad they don't warrant a review This is one of them
Most people would rather spend five years in a Hamas dungeon than endure their company
A mediocre sitcom with too many preachy subplots
An ensemble piece wobbling between undercooked drama and low-powered farce
Reuniting the Rubins is harmless unspectacular comedy let down by a poor script and light-weight direction which might have been more at home on a Sunday on ITV It isn't the worst thing you'll see this year but it will be difficult to remember
Yoav Factor can't decide whether he wants to play his broad scenario as an exaggerated farce or as a heartwarming testament to blood ties
What happens when you put a rabbi a Buddhist monk a high-strung capitalist and a lesbian humanitarian together in the same room Not comedy it turns out
The script includes little back story and lots of button-pushing shorthand none of which feels genuine
A frantic badly constructed slightly offensive muddle that doesn't so much end as run out of things on a checklist
Theoretical laughter tears and maudlin contrivance ensue
Reuniting the Rubins may walk like a comedy and quack like a comedy but despite the absurd extremes to which it takes the squabbling-family formula it inspires nary a chuckle
The Lion of Judah turns out to be a lamb and this Bible story with animals turns out to be exceedingly lame
The slapdash animation is matched in kind by the patched-together story
The film's website calls it the 'first ever -D animated family-friendly faith-based movie' but you may call it 'The Passion of the Christ' meets 'Babe'
Amateurish animation mars Christian animal tale about Jesus
The meek may inherit the Earth but they won't do well at the multiplex if they can't do better than this
Why Al Pacino why
So unforgivably soul-destroying bad it'll have you wishing Pacino had made Righteous Kill  instead
a film that may be remembered as one of the worst of the Wedding Singer actor's career
Sandler's brash unpretentious and unsubtle family comedy might be more enjoyable if it wasn't so mean
Totally mediocre
Amazingly Jack And Jill is even lousier than I feared it would be
Dennis Dugan's film mixes slapstick and jokes about diarrhoea
The worst representation of Jews on screen since Jud S
It could easily have been a single-joke poster shot in a deleted scene from Funny People Only it is less funny and less interesting
Why not go to your nearest hardware store exchange your admission fee for a pot of emulsion and watch that dry instead
The good news is that Sandler is marginally better in drag than he is playing himself

There appears to be no reason for the pitiless story this appalling movie has to tell beyond portraying Jill as an all-around despicable creature socially inept and physically disgusting incapable of grace and impossible to tolerate
Burn this This cannot be seen By anyone
another complete and total misfire from the once-reliable Adam Sandler
Jack and Jill's lack of energy disguises contempt but here Sandler's working through his issues in a more compelling way than usual
Jack and Jill is an ill-advised too long Saturday Night Live skit gone wrong It's a cartoon It's a way for all involved to pad their pockets and a way for Sandler to keep his friends employed
Hasn't Al Pacino heard Adam Sandler Sucks before now
Relentlessly witless
The worst Adam Sandler picture yet which is saying something
Overly expository dialogue abounds as do questionable filmmaking choices and plenty of stupidly unconvincing actions taken on the part of the film's characters
Doesn't even have the pulse-pounding excitement of a second-tier Scooby-Doo mystery
Quaid needs to resist hamming it up in Z-movies like Beneath the Darkness which are beneath him and pretty much everyone else
Bruce Wilkinson the film's late writer and executive producer is more than likely turning in his own grave
Someone involved with Beneath the Darkness has either watched too many horror movies or not enough
A malformed would-be horror shocker with a deliriously deranged performance by Dennis Quaid who unfortunately seems to be the only one onboard who thinks he's in a comedy
This mediocre movie should have bypassed theaters and gone straight to Netflix
The screenplay gets nothing out of the claustrophobic terror of being locked up in that narrow grave and the mystery is obvious from the start
Even Dennis Quaid's uncharacteristic hamming as a mad mortician in a small Texas town can't save this silly scare-free horror film
When it comes to creepy old buildings overly attentive owners and prying outsiders Beneath the Darkness has nada on Don Coscarelli's epic Phantasm saga or for that matter Norman Bates' clear-eyed if psychotic shenanigans
At times it seems the simple ineptitude of Beneath the Darkness surely must mask some undercurrent of deeper sophistication and intention on behalf of the filmmakers Alas as it turns out such things never surface
The best way to consider this wayward mess is as an unintentional genre spoof
Dennis Quaid goes Psycho in dull Texas-set thriller
Dennis Quaid is fun to watch as a psychotic but he leaves the screenplay behind
You anticipate every scene before it happens and figure out every secret before it's revealed
A bore sprinkled with hints of hilarity soon to be buried like so many of its characters
A compilation of contrivances and absurdities that is right off the teen-horror assembly line
While certainly a low-budget flick which relies heavily on suspense over almost everything - meaning there's a lot of cat and mouse stalking around orand talking about how spooky Ely is - Beneath the Darkness doesn't necessary sink or succeed
There's nothing in Beneath the Darkness you haven't seen before better and recently
a pervasively underwhelming thriller that wears out its welcome almost immediately
The title is an understatement
The baleful influence of Paul Haggis's multi-narrative Oscar-winner Crash  continues with Matthew Leutwyler's trite contraption
The connections seem less immediate and significant and so the movie sometimes seems based on a group of separate short stories
Answers To Nothing's thinly drawn characters orbit one another like fading satellites until their stories intersect and overlap in arbitrary ways
Even in the best ensembles there's always a weak character someone we're relieved to get away from so that we can get back to the people who interest us Here we can't wait to get away from pretty much all of them
Will make you hate words--and these idiots who refuse to stop saying them without actually saying anything at all
An overlong bunch of intertwining stories none of which is worth the viewer's time
The trick for a movie with this many loosely connected people is to find the magic or tragedy or thought that arranges them into some kind of galaxy
Some fine performances and an embrace of understatement make Matthew Leutwyler's oddly titled Answers to Nothing a respectable entry in the multiple-stories-that-interlock genre
A Short Cuts full of self-pitying sociopaths Answers to Nothing follows its characters toward a succession of increasingly queasy conclusions it tries to pass off as heartfelt and human
There's a lack of real conclusiveness to many of the film's characters and situations
Tasteless and out of touch right down to its foundation embarrassingly unaware that Crash-like hyperlink narratives went out with bird-flu paranoia
It begins with Dane Cook procuring sperm to impregnate his desperate wife with a little help from his mistress - and goes steadily downhill from there
Any movie that calls itself Answers to Nothing ought to be  percent sure it's about something
In the inexplicably titled 'Answers to Nothing' a film you might inadvertently wander into this weekend if you're unlucky
Some impassioned performances ease the flow of gloom but it's a long steady walk to the noose for a picture in dire need of Prozac and some fresh air
With his latest effort 'Answers to Nothing' co-writer-director Matthew Leutwyler appears to have confused glum with profound
An apt title that sadly recalls lesser ensemble pieces like Playing by Heart while wanting to be Grand Canyon
Reaches rather nakedly for early Paul Thomas Anderson territory but the copped moves come off less as artful homage and more as the nervous half-formed duplications of a mentee who's left the nest too soon
Nearly a dozen random themes and characters have been Scotch-taped together into a single mess
A TV movie-grade romantic farce that's practically medieval in its cornball conventionality
Some name talent probably won't be putting Scott Marshall's  stinker on their rsums
Give it points on setting and a couple of the performances but the joke-starved All's Faire in Love only rarely rises to the level of fair to middling
We've seen this kind of thing before it was old when Bill Murray did it in Meatballs
If you don't like the word 'penis' but crack up at the use of 'wang' 'ding dong' 'wenis' and 'wiener' this is your movie
Faire is as predictable as boils on a plague victim and its romantic complications are generic but the script is amusing and zounds it's nice to see Ann-Margret in the supporting role of a RenFest monarch
Marshall does manage a breezy good-natured tone toward this oft-mocked cultural phenomenon that allows for eye-rolling and smiling in equal measure
Only Ann-Margret as the fair's reigning queen retains her dignity
Finding a fresh setting for a comedy is difficult but a Renaissance fair is too broad a target
Peaks with its animated opening credits
Avoid this one like the pox
A prime contender for 's biggest cinematic embarrassment
Cheeky and underwhelming quickly to be filed under 'forgettable films'
A dinner of week-old turkey legs and stale mead would be more fun than this Ren Faire-set rom-com disaster
A disappointing psychological thriller that's had all its noteworthy twists completely ruined by its trailer
Crowbarred into the standard haunted house chills is a supposed twist that feels like Shutter Island written for drunk people
Weisz and Watts are badly served by two dimensional roles and Koteas's part in the big picture is laughably obvious
An intriguing twist livens things up midday way but the mood is almost oppressively melancholy and the plot doesn't stack up
This is a workmanlike movie that is never quite scary enough and never quite ingenious enough though the four leads do an honest enough job
The fragile hope that we might have a grown-up horror movie on our hands is smashed to smithereens
Disappears up its own fundamental implausibility
It's daft and nonsensical But it's that silliness and the sheer calibre of cast that ensure this has a certain car-crash watchability about it
This is one property you'd do well to stay away from
This is the kind of thing that happens when there is a squabble about who controls a movie Director Jim Sheridan bickered with studio over how scenes in this thriller should be shot and scenes were redone after test audiences reacted negatively
It's little surprise that Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz disowned this turgid woefully inept thriller which idiotically gave away its big reveal in the trailer
Dream House is not the film it was advertised as but beyond the wonky finale reshoots and strange editing there is an interesting tale to be told here
Dream House is clearly something of a wreck yet watching the film provides glimpses of the better film the project might have been
Dream House is a mess of a film This is not only because its writing is amateurish but also because the film itself seemed like it was someone's first attempt at putting a film together
At least Weisz and Craig wound up married after this mess
So much is just soobvious
The only real mystery is why some A-list actors and a director of Jim Sheridan's calibre would even ponder working on such an uncalled-for project in the first place
Dream House has been sold as a ghost movie but in reality it is a psychological thriller mystery with a really bad ending
This is a sunken wreck from the get-go and everyone involved knows it and just tries to get away
The final wheeze of the J-horror-inspired domestic thrillers that ran rampant a few years back
As a stupidly-entertaining implausible and downright far-fetched action flick this no-brainer does the job better than the recent  Minutes Or Less
Some movies are hard to spoof
The film's Pittsburgh location is used to nice effect but little else about the movie rings true
You look at the screen mainly because it beats staring at the auditorium walls
For an entertainment centering on teenagers the violence is I think excessive
Lautner makes a laughable attempt to become an abdominal-flaunting action star in this abominably directed spy drama
The dude is so wooden it's like watching Pinocchio with abs
more twists and holes than a bad mountain road
This uneven thriller alternates between fast-paced action and confusing plot situations but Taylor Lautner takes his shirt off again to please his fans
At not a single point in this movie is anyone abducted
The holes in the film's twist-filled story are often so big you could almost squeeze Lautner's sex appeal through them
Boring fugitive action-flick meets insipid teen romance Well before the movie shows any hint of ending you'll hope for a quick abduction by any means from the cineplex
Lautner is a distracting screen presence he's like a living Mort Drucker caricature or a 'motion capture' animated avatar of himself Even so he deserves better than this
Even subtracting Taylor Lautner's mechanical performance Abduction is an illogical train wreck riddled with messy direction bad editing tired action and plot holes galore
The jury's still out on Lautner's leading man future
In the end we're left with a semi-interesting story that was poorly executed and poorly thought out with a bad lead performance that merely exemplifies the weaknesses of the script
Card-carrying members of Team Jacob may approve but Abduction won't help turn Lautner into the action star he clearly aspires to be
Lautner fans will enjoy five separate occasions where the star takes off his shirt but for fans of worthwhile trips to the theater Abduction is hard to recommend
Never goes far wrong as long as Taylor Lautner's in motion
By the end of Abduction it's even becoming difficult for supporting actors like Sigourney Weaver and Alfred Molina to keep from laughing at the lunacy unfolding
The worst Saturday Night Live sketch movie ever made that was never actually a Saturday Night Live sketch
Swardson and the gang generally opt for silly over edgy and outrageous but Bucky is just too dashed-off a character for the movie to get by on that
A comic monstrosityplays like an unfunny idea for a raunchy five-minute sketch that's been cruelly extended to an insufferable ninety-six minutes
Of course Bucky Larson isn't one of the year's worst films because its laughs are poisoned and problematic-rather it's one of the year's worst films because there aren't any laughs at all
Through all this one feels nothing more strongly than an acute sympathy for all involved -- in particular Ricci who gives her role more than it deserves and Herrmann a classy character actor who once won a Tony
This isn't even a series of skits but a series of vague ideas for skits that nobody fleshed out
Swardson just doesn't rise to the occasion apparently hoping that enormous buck teeth and a Dutch Boy wig will do the acting for him
All involved will be known as those who took part in the worst movie of the year
This is the Tom Brady who made The Hot Chick and The Comebacks not the Tom Brady who plays football although who's to say which of them is better at making movies
This movie is dire soul-crushing stuff
Don't put yourself through this train wreck of a movie Unless of course you enjoy feeling like the screenwriter is hovering at your elbow during the film screaming GET IT after every joke
I go take seven aspirin for my current headache I do need to let you know that there's a whole other actually funny movie going on inside this one struggling to come out
The movie is embarrassingly bad
Nothing to see here kids
Icky and repellent in ways it probably did not intend
Childish
Working under the incorrect assumption that anything having to do with porn is hilarious Bucky Larson is a consistently strained comedy without much charm or wit
Putrid and completely unfunny 'Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star' is a torturous exercise for a viewer I can't count the times I wanted to walk out of this ghastly excuse for a movie Still I stayed with it I just couldn't bring myself to leave
God this guy sucks Swardson And Bucky
I'm not sure how many tedious sex jokes and humorless physical gags people can take before they run out of the theater screaming but Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star certainly tests the limits
Corny preachy and tedious
You're likely to come away from it not knowing that much more about the  Chinese Revolution and caring even less

A bombastic incoherent though occasionally eloquent period epic co-directed by Jackie Chan and Zhang Li

With '' art direction speaks louder than words
What should be rousing stuff - a republic is born the chains of feudalism thrown off - remains a kind of lavishly illustrated history lesson
Packed with so many characters and subtitled history lessons it barely allows its excellent main cast room to maneuver
May be slow going for anyone not well-versed in this chapter of Chinese history
Earnest and studious to a fault Rarely has a film about upheaval felt more like a textbook
Plodding account of how a rebel uprising led by Sun Yat-Sen helped overthrow the Qing dynasty in China
The Revolution will not be televised Gil Scott-Heron once sang Nor should it be filmed we might add -- at least not as a costume drama with stirring speeches an inspirational love story and gloriously heroic military charges
This one is a noble failure
a dry history lesson
Students of revolutionary Chinese history can have fun checking them off Look there's Li Yuanhong And over there Feng Guozhang
A historical superproduction in which style aside from committee-made widescreen tedium is spectacularly absent
At two full hours the pace drags in the final quarter
this long boring convoluted confusing feeble disgraceful film is nothing more than a clumsy Chinese Communist attempt to paint Sun Yat sen a freedom-lover as an early Communist
A haphazard grab-bag of context-free fight scenes cardboard characters and constant title cards explaining key details that the film itself can't reveal in any other way
meanders through its interminable two-hour running time with a collection of scenes that feel more like liner notes from a history book than an actual screenplay
The Burnett clan manages to encompass virtually every clich of any dramedy made in the last decade that has garnered or hoped to garner Oscar buzz
It has a terrific cast of actors doing committed work it also has a screenplay that tries so hard to be quirky that it tires itself out
It makes a small case for not succumbing to nostalgic malaise -- too bad it's in a genre as played-out as the lead characters' passion
There's not much dramatic glue here to huff leaving The Family Tree satisfying on a technical level with external developments more captivating than internal deliberation
fresh and engagingand quite funny
The only reason I can think of to watch Vivi Friedman's flat satirical farce The Family Tree - and it's not a good enough reason - is the opportunity to play a game of spot the semi-star
Friedman's inability to successfully reconcile the film's duality undercuts an eclectic cast gamely committed to Mark Lisson's thematically ambitious if scattered script
Here's a film that consists of a hodgepodge of blah Too many subplots are crammed into this dramedy that leaves little for emotion or laughter
Mad Men devotees may show up for Christina Hendricks who plays Mulroney's buxom secretary Quite the acting stretch
Think Overboard with masturbating asphyxiated teens gun-totingweed-smoking priests lesbian high school teachers preying on her students a parade of wasted talent and Bow Wow
To judge from the talent she drew for her shaky debut Vivi Friedman must either be very well connected or an awfully smooth talker
Like the body of a peeping tom high school student that hangs hidden in the Burnett's tree for the duration of the film the direction of the movie remains dangling over audiences
This black comedy about a dysfunctional family strikes out on all counts originality wit and viewer tolerance
Davis could play a role like Bunnie in her sleep Mulroney often seems to be asleep and the rest of the overqualified supporting cast just appears relieved that their screentime is limited
The Family Tree is never willing to try and really understand its family instead creating wall of surface-level quirks as shorthand for their personalities
Another around-the-bend black comedy that doesn't work
So in the end what we are presented with is a mildly affable comedy of familial dysfunction that wants to chide the times for being both morally and emotionally obtuse Instead The Family Tree winds up being little more than a film uprooted
There are too many branches on this tree trying to give every unemployed actor in Hollywood a job
a misguided and thoroughly obnoxious piece of work that wears out its welcome almost immediately
The Family Tree is a surprisingly funny dysfunctional family comedy that manages to entertain throughout
This waaay overlong Mandarin-language remake seems more the result of the kind of marketing-mentality it professes to mock
Andy Lau and Gong Li are appealing leads but this Chinese-language carbon copy doesn't find a distinctive voice
This Mandarin-language remake of the  Mel Gibson blockbuster rarely rises above a genial likability lacking sufficient comic or romantic brio
I don't know why a movie this predictable should run as long as it does
Asian superstars Gong Li and Andy Lau spark together but the script rarely produces fireworks
This convoluted mess sets new lows in underimagined overplotted narrative
How are we going to get out of here Sarah squawks at one point a question that Mr Dourif ought to have asked his agent long before the cameras began to roll
What are meant to be dazzling otherworldly images are in fact spit-take ridiculous
A lumpy melange of supernatural ingredients and distinct genre elements that never cohere
A lame-brained zombies  evil wizards hybrid
A hobbled sci-fi thriller that doesn't have the money to compete with genre big boys but also lacks an imagination in presentation or execution that might enable it to escape the downward pull of its limitations
Apart from its deficiencies as fiction whatever its philosophical limitations the rich and able should only help themselves in Rand's Objectivism the book proves proudly indigestible on film
This Sharktopus-budget-level cheap badly-acted clumsily-written and stiffly-directed movie still has a lot to offer film fans on both sides of the Great Ayn Rand Divide
I am not advocating for Rand's political point of view It is worth a discussion Only it deserves a better discussion than is given in Atlas Shrugged Part
It has a story I suppose and it even kind of has conflict Mostly it has talking Weirdly esoteric talking about weirdly esoteric things
As timely as a Tea Party rally Ayn Rand's novel finally reaches the screen - at least a part of it does
Atlas Shrugged Part I is in many ways charmingly oblivious to its inherent contradictions and the fact that its capitalist titans appear to be squatting in old abandoned Dynasty sets eating food-court baked potatoes
Its underlying worldview has little to do with its failure this could've and by all rights should've been a TV miniseries
You can feel them straining against the limitations--moreso than the budget the time compression They fought the good fight as well as they possibly could
a respectful and generally respectable filming
There is something inherently noble about making a movie that gets the audience to think a little deeper A dose of clarity and a pinch of fun never hurt either
A talky bore that spends too much time in wood-panelled offices and at chatter-heavy parties that were clearly shot on the cheap
Made on the cheap with no-name stars this is no better than a stilted anachronistic curiosity a low-rent version of the eighties' prime-time soap Dallas with the industrial concerns and sexual mores of s all somehow set in
Think of it as The Omega Code for corporations There might be a good story in there if it weren't trying too hard to make a political point
This dubious distillation of Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy is a glorified smack around the head with a sociology textbook
To quote 'The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged One is a childish fantasy that often leads to an emotionally stunted socially crippled adulthood unable to deal with the real world The other of course involves orcs
Atlas Shrugged is a passionless experience that feels like a TV movieminiseries It's flat poorly plotted thinly performed and dull to its core
An eye-rollingly clumsy amble through a Middle Earth of Monopolists -- aimed at Ayn Rand cultists and their fellow travelers
While staying true to Rand's vision Atlas Shrugged Part  suffers from poor directing and it lacks the sleekness it needs to connect with audiences
Although it's not as bad as its trailer might suggest this first part of a projected three-part series will probably please the already converted but bore and annoy just about everyone else
The awfulness of Atlas Shrugged continues a trend since the cinema has never treated Rand very well
The resultant smorgasbord is a misshapen mess short on humor tension or chemistry among its bickering protagonists
The Reunion takes its time cutting to the chase Once the inept action does start however it can't end fast enough
A split personality action comedy that fails to please either impulse The action is wan the laughs hard to come by
Cena handles rough stuff like a pro and his poker-faced wisecracking isn't bad But he probably shouldn't quit his day job
You know what you're getting about five minutes into The Reunion the kind of movie that trades brains in for guns muscles and breasts
The Reunion has no pretensions of originality and maybe that's just fine
Frequently ludicrous and cheerfully inept Michael Pavone's action comedy does manage to eke out a few drops of slapdash charm
If John Cena wants to follow in the footsteps of fellow wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne The Rock Johnson he might want to learn to smile Or at least to pick better material than The Reunion
There's one thing to be said about WWE Studios -- they're consistent Every one of their movies designed to showcase their stable of popular wrestling stars has been a critical and commercial disaster
The WWE's campaign to turn its brutes into box office deals another tepid hand with The Reunion
What's ironic about The Reunion is that its plot though it revolves around a kidnapping set in Mexico seems blind to current events
Pro wrestler John Cena stars in a WWE film about estranged half-brothers compelled to work together to rescue a kidnap victim in this old-TV-style family adventure-drama
A half-hearted redundancy which often looks and sounds like something Charles Bronson paid bills with in
Aside from some character-defining flashbacks a godawful score and sweat-enhancing color photography it's the same movie as before -- a divertingly tense yet superficial time-waster
A starry cast and glossier production values simply work against the black-and-white original's strengths in this stillborn thriller
Reinforces the popular notion that remakes are essentially low-reaching affairs that result from a lack of ideas
It's not quite the disastrous remake it could've been however by changing so little Babluani has made the same mistakes all over again
Making a film about the cutthroat world of Russian Roulette is a little like making a gambling thriller about the card game War

A one-trick movie with prefab suspense but also prefab plotting to undercut said suspense
The anticlimactic final half hour which is capped off with an oddly and needless downbeat finish cements the film's place as a curiously half-baked piece of work

Scott Rosenbaum's pallid grunge-messiah music pic neither burns out nor fades away -- try sputtering like a cigarette butt in a bottle of warm Bud Light
Unfortunately the unconvincing fictional storyline Rosenbaum weaves around this solid musical base hits every meller cliche in the self-destructive rock star playbook

VIDEO There are reasons the institution of marriage is becoming more and more obsolete Love Wedding Marriage doesn't help turn the tide
Comprised only of half-hearted melodramatics and schmaltzy bromides the film offers nothing new but plenty of things that are old borrowed and apt to make one blue
Veteran character actor Dermot Mulroney unleashes his inner cornball for this directorial debut a softly lit wind-chimes-scored diversion for the Celestial Seasonings set
This film is a prison -- and a cruel one -- for both the actors in it and the audience watching one with walls made of rock-hard impenetrable stupidity and bars of cold-forged clichs
To describe Love Wedding Marriage as sitcommy would be an insult to sitcoms which can and do succeed in inspiring genuine laughter
Love Wedding Marriage is a sitcom stretched the movie length with almost no laughs

If you haven't seen Cemetery Man director Michele Soavi's  avant-garde adaptation of Tiziano Sclavi's Dylan Dog novel and comic books I highly recommend checking it out rather than wasting your time on this muddled piece of filmic tripe

It's not so much that Dylan Dog is bad -- certainly nowhere near as bad as is being claimed -- it's that it's so completely inconsequential

It's amazing how little entertainment value there is in watching Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman play world-weary Crusaders in a movie called Season Of The Witch Come on It's Ghost Rider and Hellboy

Director Dominic Sena sets a quick pace the dull moments are brightened by the unexpectedly likable team of Cage and Perlman
Guns are fun in movies but bashing about with broadswords speaks to the -year-old in all of us
God's teeth
Cage's disappointingly subdued performance stands as the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back
Although I will likely be disemboweled from my toes to my nose metaphorically speaking only I hope for this proclamation I didn't think Season of the Witch was all that bad
I may be in the minority of critics to think so but Season Of The Witch is an enjoyable medieval thriller that's well-made in spite of some moments of silliness
Have low expectations for this movie and you might just be surprised
It's an Uwe Boll kind of film that's been directed with a certain degree of competency by previous Cage collaborator Dominic Sena
Another forgettable trifle from Cage
After a while the movie tires of the witch business and trots out a plot twist that permits the effects department to spend money
Not the stinker that everyone says it is but you do have to ignore its flaws in order to be entertained
The filmmakers try to use special effects to cover up the weaknesses of the story but even on that point they fail pretty badly
Cage merely stands around looking glum letting his hair extensions do the acting for him
What do hip hop and rooftops have in common You'll have to go see Beat the World to find out Though you may discover it wasn't worth the effort
The Step Up series may not be great cinema but at least it's smart enough to cast actors and teach them to dance
A silly hip-hop dance-crew drama like Beat the World -- in which Brazil Germany and Canada are revealed to be the three funkiest nations in the world yo -- does not just feel old-school It just feels old
There aren't enough parkour moves -- or frankly any stand-out moves -- to elevate Fusion to the winner's circle
World is a lazy movie with only a faint hint of conflict dusted over repetitive and illogical dance sequences It's a bore from start to finish Again you probably already knew that
Based on a play and adapted by the original playwright sadly the narrative hasn't translated at all well and the structure feels out of place
Not just bad Planet-smashingly bad
A plodder that prefers to explain and then repeat the explanation rather than let the audience use their imagination
Nakata skilfully takes us into the real and virtual lives of a group of London teenagers and shows us with terrifying consequences the power and ability to manipulate reality in a virtual world
'The Social Network' and 'Catfish' prove there are ripe films to be made on the dark side of web connectivity but this is the rotten apple of the bunch
Definitely zeigeisty but short on thrills
A film that never approaches the real-life terror of discovering your broadband's down
In the end Nakata's notion of a web gone wild has moments of visual merit but is a little too clinical and coldly cynical
There are times when Nakata skilfully blends the real world with cyber unreality to illustrate how impressionable youngsters can end up wondering just which world they are in at any time
Poorly written and badly acted Chatroom squanders its only decent idea early on and rapidly descends into a shallow-minded lifeless thriller that fails to engage on any level whatsoever
The gimmick is so poorly conceived that we spend most of the film converting what we are being shown into what is actually going on It isn't worth the effort
There's a great idea here but this awkward and dated film struggles to bring the cyberspace experience to life in the form of a gritty teen thriller
Plausible chills are offset by the film's clumsy youth-movie trimmings which through lurid visuals and ripe overacting by its largely unknown cast drain most of the suspense and interest
The film finally fizzles into feeble melodrama with all the power of an old episode of Grange Hill
Director Hideo The Ring Nakata never connects with the script by Enda Walsh adapting from his own play
A movie of utter unspeakable hideous awfulness A movie that makes you want to prise open your brain and scoop out all memory of having watched it
Pantomimic dialogue stagey sets and underwritten characters render this instantly obsolescent
Nakata - here making his English language debut - fails to drum up much in the way of tension from the plot's hoky attempt to exploit fears about the existence of online suicide clubs
Unfortunately the scenes set in the real world the locations include Camden Lock and the London Zoo are stilted and unconvincing while those in the chatrooms become increasingly tedious
Shallow violent movie could spark teen discussion
This movie is just a lot of people staring at each other by the light of a fire
Mixes the melodrama of Twilight with the hokey horror of The Village but falls short of being 'so bad its good' It's just not good
Mildly diverting if you're curious but don't expect to be blown away
this gorgeously-mounted production fails to rouse the primitive ferocity of the primal beauty and the beast tale
This one's a retake on 'Twilight' I'd hang out in a different hood if I had the chance
What truly needs abolishing is the notion that the wretched Twilight saga is worth emulating
Bloodless on every level
Like Twilight makes the shallow desire to run away with a boy the heroine's main concern
Have you had questions about the motivations of the wolf or suspicions about Grandma Have you pondered the sexual connotations of this age-old fairy tale Me neither Just the same someone has made a movie about
Oh my God you can talk Valerie exclaims at one point when confronted by the wolf he can't Oh my God I've wasted almost two hours of my life in this theatre
Sexualising a beloved children's fairy tale seems an odd move but when flanked by an unoriginal story and lacklustre performances that appears to be the least of the film's problems
it perfectly sums up the muddled feeling of a gothic horror romance that never feels all that romantic nor particularly scary
Catherine Hardwicke what the Hell happened
With this film and the first Twilight Hardwicke has shown that she doesn't have much talent for direction and that she isn't that good a judge of material if this is the kind of film she keeps choosing
For all the heaving bosoms the big-eyed flirtation and the cool Medieval fairytale hair products it doesn't work
The CGI wolf would have been rubbish a decade ago the clearly indoor village set looks like it once featured in an old episode of Star Trek and the central love story is lacking in bite
Trite dialogue poor special effects and an insubstantial storyline make this one a bit of a dud
'Beware the wolf' warn Red Riding Hood's posters and television ads Be even warier of this movie
Gary Oldman is the one bright light in this tired drama that deserves neither his talent or your time
While it's nice to see renewed interest in genre fiction from a teenage girl standpoint these new monsters don't have much bite to them
Aside from providing the inspiration for  Rock's fake Tracy Jordan movie Honky Grandma Be Trippin' it's hard to see the value of this sporadic Martin Lawrence-wears-a-fat-suit-and-a-dress saga
As magical as ever
Can there really be a comparative and a superlative for unfunny It doesn't make sense to describe this witless embarrassing third film in the Big Momma franchise as the unfunniest
What's funnier than a black dude in drag How about two black dudes in drag
This is number three and the bloom is off the rose Martin leave the drag to Tyler Perry and Madea
It's a true rubber-necker's delight a comedy so inconceivably tacky that it will make you question whether or not you're laughing at the film or with it
John Whitesell who helmed BM keeps the gender-flipping gags firing with a sense of seriousness that seems blind to the inanity of the granny-panty flimsy plot
Oh come on now Knock it off
It's tempting to call Big Mommas Like Father Like Son a huge waste of talent but considering the talent involved that doesn't seem like much of a waste
I'm no fan of Perry's blunt-force morality comedies but at least his pseudo-sainted materfamilias is a real character
It only escapes a bomb rating because it's more irritating than offensive -- like an ant crawling across a counter top rather than a roach roosting in the cereal box
lame contrivances and stale drag jokes
The first one wasn't all that great The second one I barely remember seeing
I laughed when it was as dumb as it should be I was bored when it wasn't
If you didn't enjoy the first two movies don't see this
A mashup of 'Some Like It Hot' leering rooster-in-the-henhouse voyeurism and 'Glee' peppy musical interludes that on the plus side grapples with the potent issue of young black male identity
it is likely that this shambles will be the final nail in the coffin of the career of a man once touted as The Next Eddie Murphy
Looking back it's strange to remember that the first two movies were both hits and that Paul Giamatti and Terrence Howard even saw enough in the premise to sign up for the original At this point it's really all just flab
It's frighteningly impressive that a one-note gag has spawned three dreadful films and hundreds of millions of dollars in box office receipts Wherever will they go next Big Mommas D
The fatherstepson angle applies a much-needed Heimlich maneuver to a series that was choking but it's not enough
Reasonably entertaining if unexceptional
Another serial killer movieand this one's so bad it reaffirms how often we take even mediocre pictures for granted
A negligible effort in almost every conceivable way this film's belated micro-release by New Films International is really a glamorized four-wall effort in the Roger Corman tradition prefacing what should be a very quick transition to DVD
A laughable mish-mash of slasher-flick recyclables dumb characterizations backed by abysmal acting and head-scratching plot mechanics
Each contrived twist and every routine turn makes the waiting game for the end credits to roll seem that much longer
A complete and utter mess
We know we're going to see Olivia Wilde in her birthday suit - wintry weather be damned
Graham Parker once said passion is no ordinary word Here it's worth less than dirt
You can do worse than a movie that features Megan Fox stripped down to her tattoos and Bill Murray as a pinstriped gangster who says things like Kill him and bring her back here
Conjuring magic it goes abracadabra and snaps its fingers but nothing happens
You almost wonder if the whole thing isn't just one big campy joke
It's like a movie someone says at some point Yeah like one But not quite
Screenwriter Mitch Glazer's directing debut is a romantic fable about love redemption and exquisitely art-directed squalor whose evident sincerity is overwhelmed by its utter ridiculousness
From the cheesy score to the nonsensical plot to the half-asleep performances Passion Play is a snooze
Despite a gorgeous poster a beautiful object of affection and cult-worthy actors Passion Play fails to transform from a poetic pet project into a fully realized film
The net effect is as if someone had set out to imitate a David Lynch movie without ever having seen one or as if it had been directed by Wim Wenders which is approximately the same thing
Black Swan meets Water For Elephants sort of And is Mickey Rourke's male cougar character's obsession with his leading lady's wings in this post-mortem noir possibly suspect intimations of either bestiality or necrophilia Who cares
This underworld fairy tale is so soggy and sentimental it's like a new genre Hallmark noir
Mickey Rourke recently made headlines for dubbing Passion Play a terrible movie a proclamation that's ultimately most notable for its understatement
The very definition of a cinematic curiosity a movie that seems almost too strange to exist
There's undeniable entertainment value in accidental absurdity but Passion Play strikes a note of delirium that's downright painful to process
One of the funniest most pretentious art house flicks of the year
Peculiarly bad It's one of those total misfires that wanders so far off the track that you're left scratching your head
A vanity project from successful Hollywood screenwriter Mitch Glazer this film should really be much funnier than it is Oh it's not a comedy by the way Not at all
Perhaps it's needless to say but Rourke and Fox are a thoroughly mismatched screen couple who exude zero screen chemistry with one another
full review at Movies for the Masses
This often risible mood piece stars Megan Fox as a circus sideshow attraction who has actual angel wings growing out of her back Rather than doing the sensible thing and joining the X-Men she instead decides to make out with Mickey Rourke Go figure
Billy Zane's toe-curlingly awful turn as a preening design professor turns out to be the main entertainment value on display
The Roommate can't be taken seriously - for all Meester's genuine efforts it's basically moronic games with the mentally ill - but it also misses the opportunity to go for broke into a zone of full-tilt trash that might at least have been some fun
There are some interestingly nasty moments and some chills but it's predictable and derivative
The plot never picks up steam there are gaping implausibilities and the characters are achingly dull with the exception of Billy Zane's hilariously smarmy and sleazy professor
You could spend the entire movie texting your friends and not miss a thing which I suppose its target audience may consider an asset
The biggest jolt the film can muster comes when the viewer's head hits the back of the chair after nodding off
Elicits snores and guffaws thanks to workmanlike 'shock' moments and obvious twists
A disaster from start to finish
Bunk
Christiansen's witless badly acted thriller is a throwback to the early s
Christainsen chooses a teen-friendly rating over cheap titillation and his uneven tone squanders all the ingredients for a good horror movie completely
a Miss Teen Fatal Attraction  with baked kitten replacing rabbit stew on the menu
More fun than getting stabbed at least
It is as bland as movies get There's not one single nod or wink to the audience and it never manages to develop even an iota of suspense What's really weird is its complete reliance on a slick modern rock soundtrack that never seems to stop
It might be genius compared to Single White Female  The Psycho but know that The Roommate is ultimately about as sensitive as that dtv sequel sounds
A storyline that unimaginatively rehashes countless pivotal elements from other stalker-themed movies means that the whole production is a dull and pointless exercise that twists and turns in precisely the manner you expect it to
the direction of the film is fraught with problems and one feels that the promising young cast deserved better than this
One dry hump of almost thrills that are incredibly lackluster and void of any sort of suspense or tension
it's hardly worth sticking around for the routine climax of this toothless thriller just to see the ocular sweets get all chewed up and mangled
Instead of attempting to create a unique thriller the filmmakers chose to make a typical one with bland characters and lackluster twists
Crudely produced the action scenes have no zip the drama is underpowered and the performances have a bit of an am-dram feel
A low-budget British thriller that is comfortably the worst film I can remember seeing threadbare plot clunking dialogue brain-dead conspiracy theorising and a gallery of embarrassing racial stereotypes Avoid at all costs
If you don't have the budget to make an action movie don't try to make one
The dialogue is so painfully naive that it seems to have been written by a -year-old who has read nothing but Alistair MacLean novels
North  East suffers from a clunky title and a lack of credibility
Even John Rhys-Davies as the PM struggles to lend gravitas to the comically earnest dialogue and knee-jerk conspiracy theorising
A half-baked political thriller that reeks of a feature-length student YouTube clip
Writer-director Tristan Loraine has grand schemes in the pipeline but this absurd stab at sub-Tom-Clancy conspiracy thrills won't help his credentials When Craig Fairbrass is your closest thing to a badge of quality be afraid
The fiendish scheme crumbles under an onslaught of machine-tooled plot twists and a barrage of expository dialogue
The storyline is hackneyed and nonsensical as if Loraine had plucked clichs from episodes of The Professionals and strung them together
As a low-budget quickly-made Brit flick this is impressive for its ambition but as a globe-spanning political thriller it lacks credibility and veers into the absurd
Messy and curiously dated in tone This fails to make you care about the convoluted plot with ill-drawn characters
Charging boldly into battle  North  East manages to conquer its low-budget shortcomings emerging bruised battered but ultimately triumphant
An indistinct romantic-dramedy-ish something or other
When not indulging in nostalgic flipbook-style flashbacks director Keach shoots his material with sub-sitcom flatness and regularly returns to the indie-balladeer well to amplify the mawkishness
A movie that eludes the viewer's grasp because it's arguing a position auds will find instinctively wrong
An ill-conceived romantic drama that's as sappy vague and awkward as its title
If your idea of a great Valentine's Day is to ring up your secret beloved and breathe heavily into the phone this is the movie for you
Waiting for Forever is strangely unaware of its overt creepiness
By the time Emma realizes that something might be wrong with her playful pajama-clad paramour there are so many red flags she might as well be at a communist rally
Waiting for Forever isn't just bad it's fascinatingly bad
Director James Keach's movie is so annoyingly dipsy-doodle that TV veteran Bilson trying hard to look haunted and angsty is boxed in
A refreshingly pure honest and original love story
More often than not I felt suffocated by the gaseous sentimentality and lightheadedness of a story that drops in subplots that it can't begin to develop
With Waiting for Forever an insipid contemporary fairy tale about a lovestruck young vagabond shadowing a childhood sweetheart he can't bring himself to approach we get stalking juggling and cancer Happy Valentine's Day
A drippy romance that makes Nicholas Sparks look like Leo Tolstoy
As annoyingly nonsensical as its title this film makes a would-be compassionate case for-wait for it-stalkers
A suggestion to screenwriters Stop telling stalkers that their passion isn't misplaced and that the girl will come around in the end It is and she won't
Waiting for Forever evidently is an attempt to portray love as purest when expressed by those who are most innocent untainted by the ugliness of the real world But it misses the mark completely coming off instead as creepy
Oppressively quirky from start to finish
It's not a love story It's a stalker story
Perhaps they figured as it was six years since the last one we all might have forgotten the same old jokes from before
There are less laughs in this tired threquel which continues to revel in its not-quite-a-swear surname and the ups and downs of family life this time with an added emphasis on kids and mortality
Schindler's List was funnier than this
Third time out for the Meet the Parents franchise and it's all but impossible to suppress a groan
Oh Mr De Niroit hurts to see you like this
Perhaps the most dubious comedy franchise in movie history Little Fockers takes another hobbling step toward cinema infamy
Features the same comedy of embarrassment and vulgarity as its predecessors but also takes a strange sideways step into machismo that leaves it feeling rather joyless
With the gags cranked up on the humiliation-o-meter and otherwise stripped of wit the film offers little in the way of humor to anyone other than sadists
A mapped minefield of bad jokes
as dire a comedy as you're likely to see all decade
There's nothing like starting out an alleged comedy romp with a disgusting joke about a man's posterior vomit and sex talk
Low-brow humor and forced sight gags rule the day
That talents like De Niro and Stiller would sign off on such a turgid and bone idle attempt to part families with their Christmas cash is stultifying
full review at Movies for the Masses
Utterly formulaic but not unfunny despite an overreliance on the comedy of below-the-belt pain prostates and erections are particularly abused
When you're easily outshined by any given episode of Rules of Engagement or Two and a Half Men that means there's a problem
Not up to the high standards set by the first two films but without a doubt a funny and diverting holiday comedy
Little Fockers is merely a forgettable romp with these worn out characters
The whole enterprise is tired and exhausted and indifferent even the title is irrelevant and dissembling
Families will flock to the holiday release with gusto but it's up for debate whether  minutes with the Focker and Byrnes families is worse than quality time with your own dysfunctional clan
This is not just lesser Hemingway it's the worst of him
Vet British helmer John Irvin's mannered bloodless and appallingly thesped filmization of Hemingway's posthumous novel though unlikely to set the author rolling in his grave may still have viewers rolling in the aisles
Flirts with camp but stifling boredom ultimately trumps any unintentional hilarity
The dialogue and plot in Garden Of Eden are rendered clearly and precisely without a lot of fine shading The result is a movie that's all surface all silly silly surface
'Hemingway's Garden' of Eden will restore no luster to the celebrity writer-adventurer
Ms Suvari's Catherine is so extravagantly monstrous that Mr Huston's David who provides a desultory narration comes across as an inert nonentity
Better than it might have been yet still a definite letdown a literary B-side turned into something not awful just forgettable
Everybody flirts with everyone else as director John Irvin pours on a level of shopping-mall-gift-shop-kitsch that would shame Wayne Newton
Nothing will protect the audience from this dreadful film except to stay far away from the few theaters unwise enough to show it
The acting rings false and the clothes rooms and locations never feel lived in You always feel aware that you are on a movie set watching actors perform
It just seems like a bunch of actors playing dress-up
a sexy psychological thriller much better suited for a younger crowd than the literature buffs who may be drawn to it
A borderline terrible movie that plays like a parody of a Hemingway story
Papa they've done you wrong again in this dreadful miscast Hemingway adaptation
With Hemingway pictured as a wuss and laughable acting could this be intended as camp
A veteran director the attractive lead performers and some stunning settings cannot bring credibility to this inherently stilted story
A soft-core Jazz Age skin flick masquerading as high art
In this Riviera vacation atmosphere all sun sand and skin the dialectic of opposites the film attempts to enforce instead melts down to little more than kinky foreplay
The question that occurs is not whether director Irvin hates actors but rather how much We can imagine him shouting to the cast 'Once more with less feeling Get shallow Can't you do worse than that'
Sex has never felt more repellent after watching Eden a clumsy effort of eroticism and psychological gamesmanship that's utterly devoid of structure and feeling It's an awful picture
The film has no pulse and feels interminable with its stilted dialogue static staging and usually fine actors who are horrendous here
Mark Young's bargain-basement thriller is as witless as the captor's motive to paraphrase another well-dressed Madsen psycho this little doggie barks but it has no bite
A spectacularly boring chamber thriller
What dribbles out is a series of repetitive dull clichd showdowns until most of the cast is gruesomely dispatched and the twist-that-isn't-a-twist is revealed
There's little fun involved for either the audience or the diner patrons
Strains to wring tension from a tired premise and an airless script
Thrillers that rely on tension-building within a small group of characters are harder to pull off than aspiring filmmakers may have been led to believe Look no further than The Killing Jar for proof
This utterly mediocre forget-me-now could've been crafted by any faceless serial director at all
disappointing in the way it drags out its narrative to little effect substituting cheap revelations and sometimes incoherent action for anything resembling the kind of innovation and verve that is the hallmark of Craven's best work
Craven's writing starts out over the top and just keeps climbing
My Soul to Take ends up being mere Chucky cheese
While there's much to like about the ideas and atmosphere Craven can't muster much out of his characters or script to form an interesting message
The best thing about My Soul to Take is that it may force folks to revisit Wes Craven's past works and finally realize that he's always been nothing more than a hack in the horror field a Uwe Boll with a better sense of where to place the camera
With either too much or too little happening on screen and a script juggling too many red herrings at once My Soul to Take feels like Purgatory in D
It's talky schlocky and stalk-y
the film not only marks a low point within Craven's career but also within the horror genre itself
There's some malarkey about each kid having inherited one of the maniac's personalities though Craven never does much with that except to point the finger of suspicion at junior
Confused poorly executed sporadic and incredibly messy but despite its pitfalls My Soul to Take is an enormously entertaining bad movie
Clunky bird metaphors blind kids grabbing for dangling ropes a Horshack-ian best friend with an abusive stepfather and a story that would be impossible if any of these kids drove a car sum up most of the more obvious problems with the film
full review at Movies for the Masses
Is it just possible that Craven fumbled the ball this time and gave us the equivalent of a fairly amateur teen horror flick
Everyone in front of and behind the camera look and feel like they're lifting the heaviest least horrifying ton of bricks invented
The filmmaker's red herrings prove depressingly incapable of hiding the real fiend's identity
A single-serving package of adrenaline that wears off quickly
My Soul to Take is one of the most banal horror films I've seen in the past few years which makes it surprising that it comes from the mind of horror master Wes Craven who gave birth to the legendary horror icon Freddy Krueger
Places too much time in the hands of disposable characters - so that it is neither a brainless slasher flick nor an immersive character piece based in a serial massacre
What Wes Craven wound up with was a witless stab-the-teen time-waster that could be his worst film ever And considering 's wretched Cursed that's pretty bad
The D is barely-there the clanging machine-rock soundtrack is merciless and the traps are decidedly ho-hum Even running its final lap Saw still oozes mediocrity
It's kind of amusing in the sheer silliness of its splattery shenanigans I don't think that was intended but I'll take whatever value I can get out of the thing
The filmmakers continue to regurgitate the same pile of puke each and every year for us to lap up Sure those chewed chunks of bile-soaked carrot are now in eye-popping D but that certainly doesn't make them taste any better
HateHATE
More proof that the MPAA's ratings system is useless If the level of gory violence in these Chuck Jones-meets-Herschell Gordon Lewis set-pieces doesn't demand an NC- designation what does
RIP Jigsaw Stay dead
Well I think I've finally seen the final Saw this time in D
Saw D may just be the Saw-iest Saw film of them all
Fast-paced and straight-faced and full of ewwww' moments that play up to the film's effectively cheesy use of D
The Saw franchise ends with a blood-soaked whimper
The epic game-changing twist of an ending which brings the series effectively full circle is so ridiculously even laughably over-the-top and off-the-rails that it feels more akin to the quirky self-aware tone set by the last film
The novelty has worn off and familiarity has kicked in as the creators show no signs of deviating from a well-worn formula Now it's the Police Academy of its style
Clearly the Producers have no more ideas for this franchise It's a good thing they are ending the way they wanted to To bad its not an ending fans will enjoy or deserve
It wasn't the finale I had wanted relying mostly on unimpressive revisions on previous films attempting to create a series-spanning plot against one man
Unlikely to satisfy anyone but its most loyal fans this brings the series to a stumbling close
If only the people behind this series would watch some of the older horror films to discover what makes them good Although after six clones of the same film it seems unlikely that they'll ever be able to figure it out
Another thin Saw franchise installment Fans of the series will find plenty of the same horrors to enjoy but the film furthers the series' decline into mediocrity
The D effects don't help at all in this bland and easily-forgettable entry in the long-running series
Saw D is the seventh Saw I've seen and maybe the sickest-which is exactly what I said about Saw VI
If you've been disappointed with the way the series has been going up until this point Saw D isn't exactly going to change how you feel
There's no hiding the fact that Bonded By Blood is ultimately pretty anaemic giving no further insight into an already over-exposed incident
Decently made and well-acted but with a whiff of glossy high-life voyeurism
One must question whether it needs to exist at all ploughing as it does an already well-worn crime-film furrow
A thin wan script acting that's mostly embarrassing and a stream of foul expletives where a script should be
A pungent mess of gangster cliche
Willfully exploitative
Uninspired ridiculously sweary British gangster thriller that's let down by tedious characters a badly written script and a dull storyline that fails to provide a reason to care
Though director Sacha Bennett's effort is well shot and evokes its mid-nineties setting well its disjointed structure makes for a weak narrative and only in the third act does it finally come together with any sort of momentum or urgency
Everything from script to performances goes through the motions with only Vincent Regan's Mickey registering in more than one dimension
Based on the same true story previously told on film with skill 's Essex Boys and without 's Rise of the Footsoldier it's kind of difficult to understand why there's yet another movie version Especially one as uninteresting as this
Worth watching but the whole just isn't nearly as effective as some of the parts
This movie's like an audiobook accompanied by visuals from a -year-old copy of Vogue
Plays like a melodramatic rip-off of Bret Easton Ellis books about insufferable kids obsessed with money drugs and themselves
Schumacher can't keep himself from the kind of vibey camera and editing flourishes that facilitate only viewer numbness
It feels as shopworn as a dusty VHS tape of Less Than Zero
It all comes off as faintly absurd
Twelve is so much less than zero
The result isn't awful but it is awfully familiar When will someone make a film about being old poor and ugly in Omaha
Bleak intense look at the high life of NYC's young elites
Another disappointing portrait of rich spoiled kids based on an estimable novel though you can't blame the actors for the shallow glitzy tale directed by Joel Schumacher
Like most of its characters Twelve is too cool for school
Want to punch the narrator in the face Good we're on the same page
Sinks under the weight of its own pretensions
One of the charactersastutely describes herself as 'shallow and narcissistic' So's the movie
An unsavory piece of dreary mindless ick from a director who can't seem to get his act together these days That is if he ever had an act to begin with
Joel Schumacher's talent exceeds his ambition in Twelve
The film version of Twelve is quite the opposite of the book a dull and thoughtless ride with a sad excuse for a climax
Give Schumacher credit for making a movie that is at the very least unique in its failure
There are absolutely no surprises in Twelve None And the characters are as familiar as the story--a stock collection of prep school males and females that look as if they've never sat through a class in their lives
Overburdened with too many characters and a manufactured conclusion Twelve wastes a solid performance by Chace Crawford
irritating
It's amateurish woefully acted by a majority of the cast and features music even Miley Cyrus would be embarrassed to sing but it's certainly kooky Compellingly so at times
It's a bubblegum mess lacking structure coherenceand any sense of drama But it manages moments of daft fun sometimes in spite of itself
Standing Ovation will have its work cut out for it at the viciously competitive box office but the film may serve as a springboard for the eager and able talent on display
A glittery string of backstage conventions Backstabbing Pushy parents Precocious stars Blind ambition But if you're a tween and don't watch Glee the cliches will be new to you
It's an amateurish poorly assembled and incompetently performed collection of musical comedy cliches
Standing Ovation is an innovative film in the sense that every minute or so it comes up with a different way of being annoying
I had never heard of the people in Standing Ovation before I saw it and I hope never to hear of any of them again
'Standing Ovation' isn't a movie It's an endurance test for anyone over the age of  Parental Review also available
Here's an oddball low-budget movie aimed at tweens that has a couple of things going for it
Leaves one wistful for the cable-level adequacy of Disney Channel's High School Musical films
Despite its absurdly optimistic title Standing Ovation deserves a resounding chorus of boos and maybe a few well-aimed tomatoes
For us grinchy adults out there without children to sedate the whole thing feels slightly less like a movie than like the filmed record of a mutiny at a juvie talent agency
Parents and anyone beyond adolescence will find it an intolerable attempt to cash in by imitating films they've seen before
This lame musical advertises itself as 'the most rockin' movie of the summer' Replace 'rockin'' with 'rotten' and they would just about have it right
The cast is energetic but the talent is amateurish and the script is dead on arrival
Tween musical competition with mean behavior name-calling
A slight poorly thought-out take on Disney's plethora of music franchises
They don't suck as much as lame-brain parodists Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer
It's not quite as bad as Friedberg and Seltzer's usual output but only in the way that measles is better than mumps
Vampires Suck misses its targets in spectacular fashion thanks to the directors' usual approach of simply recreating scenes from the original movies without any real understanding of what to satirise or even how to go about it
A witless puerile spoof of the Twilight movies
A movie that will have you pining to watch the real Twilight films Yes it's that bad
There was a time when for a certain generation the release of a new Naked Gun or Hot Shots movie would be cause for real excitement
Casting two lookalikes and coaching your young actors to mimic the trio from 'Twilight' isn't enough to make for a great parody
Only Friedberg and Seltzer could film this dross with the belief they are making even a half-decent comedy
A banal mess that sacrifices anything resembling satire for a series of smutty jokes
There are few things worse than watching a comedy flatline for over an hour tossing its funny parts into a vacuum of uncomfortable silence
An insult to other bad vampire movies which is saying a mouthful
All but the most die-hard fans can agree that the Twilight movies are spoof-worthy So it's too bad they don't get a worthy spoof
It is as monotonous and predictable as rain in November
It's almost as cynical as the actual Twilight and not nearly as funny
I know comedy is subjective so grant me that Vampires Suck just did not make me laugh It probably doesn't help that as a spoof on the Twilight franchise it's making fun of movies I also don't enjoy
For the most part the jokes are mildly relevant at least
Vampires Suck and films like it not only fail to parody elements of contemporary society they barely spoof the genre they are trying to mock
A witless slavish pastiche of the series of romantic dramas based on Stephenie Meyer's Twilight novels It is a knowing film that knows nothing about comedy
With the level of humor here running to flatulence jokes groin kicks and high-school smart-aleck cracks their movie does indeed surely no other critic in the world will be this clever SUCK
It's been two whole years since the team of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer subjected us to one of its godawful parodies Alas the vacation is over
Mere words can barely describe the sheer inanity on display
The film is an unmitigated disaster a putrid patchwork of the original series stitched together by wretched performances bad creative decisions and a story that's all exposition no depth
As far as children's entertainment goes and it is children's entertainment it could be a lot worse
The constant references to 'benders' can't help but elicit sniggers from British audiences  the plotting is stodgy the dialogue stinks and the acting is wooden
Is it a masterpiece Oh god no but I'm intrigued to see where the next film goes
An amateurish mess
Kiddie-strength action scenes drag the film down but the kiss of death is Shyamalan's gratuitous use of earth tones and the general dull drab look of the film  drastically reduces the intensity of the -D effects
The Last Airbender is a horrific mish-mash of genres that follows a depressingly large number of dead ends in adapting its source material
The Last Airbender is swollen with portentous mumbo jumbo and realized in the most simplistic and mundane ways imaginable
Bad acting overstuffed exposition and running time far too brief for the amount of plot shoved into it reduce The Last Airbender into parody of a big summer film as Shyamalan manages to hit every single fantasy film pothole
This is a kid's movie that doesn't seem to realize that it's a kid's movie
Shyamalan works so much better with stories that are slower in development where the atmosphere and tone drive the film and where you're never quite sure what's going on though not in the sense where you're completely confused like this film
There's no third-act twist because we never get out of the first act
Writerdirector M Night Shyamalan's once glorious reputation is tarnished further by this tediously juvenile fantasy adventure
Nothing here is helped by M Night Shyamalan's bizarre casting choices
Would it be more accurate to call this The Last Shyamalan Movie
A quite breathtakingly inept hodge-podge of vapid spirituality playground chopsocky and visual effects that take D to an entirely new level Zero-D
A breathtakingly clueless misconceived stupid humourless unexciting dim dumb farrago the worst film I've seen in years
The Last Airbender is not just a flop it's a big-budget flop and it's a throwback to that grand old genre the movie that's so bad that it's bad
There isn't a single convincing performance in the picture and the badness of the acting is bizarrely pretty much in direct proportion to a character's importance
If root canal surgery feels too childish a torment may we direct your attention to this ghastly celebrity roast in the guise of a boisterous family comedy
Frankly if this makes you laugh even once I recommend seeking medical advice
Sandler's abysmal script cooks up a bite-sized moral for the finale Groan ups more like
Like The Big Chill with farting grandmothers
Full of obvious jokes and schmaltzy sentiment Grown Ups is as much fun as watching endless home movies of people you really don't know very well
You've seen these actors play these characters many times before and better
Not much more than an in-joke between the actors this film is amiable but never funny And despite some hackneyed moralising it has nothing to say
Despite some passable gags and a whole posse of middle-aged funnymen Denis Dugan's comedy is about the least grown-up movie you could see
The shameless sentiment a cute little girl wants to use the car GPS to locate heaven and Sandler's ego-tripping he's married to Salma Hayek and he's a sure shot on the basketball court interfere with the laughs
There's almost no plot and loads of schmaltz but the hidden metaphors and cast chemistry makes this a worthwhile effort
Surprisingly amazingly bafflingly uncomedic and unhilarious
Grown Ups heralds a sad day for comedy nostalgists of a certain age Call it the day the amusement died
Grown Ups is the perfect poster child for this maddening summer of movie mediocrity
The second half of Grown Ups isn't good enough to dig its way out of the tremendous hole it's created for itself but it's far from the worse thing Sandler has ever made Maybe in another  years he'll make something funny
Five forgettable characters reunite for a lame joke-filled weekend
Doesn't so much play like a film than random home movies of Sandler and his usual screen cronies on vacation
The title mainly leaves one wondering when Sandler will chose to finally grow up and stop starring in this ongoing series of terrible comedies
Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a good time
Grown Ups is cliched predictable and full of immature and juvenile humor The film recycles far too many jokes and it gets old real fast
Finding Grown Ups funny necessitates that one finds it inherently marvelous when fat men talk about eating old women describe having sexual desires and old fat women break wind
Despite the occasional keeper of an image this is one gay vampire film that's surprisingly anemic
Unlike the modern glamour-vamps of True Blood and Twilight this group of smitten and bitten men are no fun at all
For select fans of campy gay comedies Eulogy for a Vampire turns out to be a yell-at-the-screen experience no different from Plan  From Outer Space or Mystery Science Theater
It's hard to imagine anyone watching this attempt at a horror film without guffawing Or maybe it's supposed to be a comedy
The gay-themed Eulogy for a Vampire is dead serious about its mix of eroticism and horror but the more serious it tries to be the campier it becomes
Often drags and suffers from a painfully lazy bland and contrived screenplay It's a poorly-directed lifeless mess with wooden performances and pretentious cinematography
Silly sequel to 's camp vampire film with gore nudity
It's meager parade of drab kills and uninspired cartoon weaponry leaning on Feldman to bring Lost Boys magic he doesn't possess
Feldman's got to eat I guess
while Feldman's performance doesn't raise the movie beyond the ordinary it keeps you from wanting to put your foot through the screen
Better than its predecessor which fine isn't saying a whole lot
a bucket of cheese
Not so terrible that you can understand why it's been practically buried by its distributors but you can get better ridiculous whodunits on TV
The murders are simply chalk marks on a blackboard with no build-up and little fallout
Disappointing badly plotted thriller let down by some dodgy acting poor direction and a script that makes The Da Vinci Code look like a masterpiece
A polished but verbose whodunit that's surprisingly buttoned-down given helmer Alex de la Inglesia's rep for comicbook wackiness
A wonderfully compelling mess of a movie It's tricky trying to bond Hitchcockian flair with lecture hall semantics but the director works his tricks with ace visual consideration
So bad it's good then Alas the whole thing is uncomfortable and boring scotching any ironic enjoyment of its awfulness
The Scooby Doo ending requires nearly ten minutes of explanation and negates the need to follow the previous  minutes It's also preceded by one character stating In life nobody bothers explaining anything Well except in this movie
A math- and symbology-tinged thriller adapted by director lex de la Iglesia and pitched at a breakneck didactic clip absent any sensible modulated emotional investment in the characters or material
This purported whodunit thriller never solves its main mystery How and why did this film get made in the first place
Hurt sells the silliness almost convincingly but even from such a skillful pitchman it comes out sounding finally like junk
The novelty quickly fades since -- you guessed it -- the story's just not there
It's as if Pixar never happened
You could do worse with young kids and they'll romp along with Marmaduke's throwaway adventures it's just there's much better stuff out there that will entertain viewers above the age of  too
While not quite as bad as it could have been this is very much Hollywood-schmaltz-by-numbers
Never veers from The Hollywood Guide To Mid-Budget Family Fare
With his eyes goggling and his gob smudging all over the place he looks like a haunted painting
Although comfortably under  minutes Marmaduke is an epic chore to sit through
Generally has its heart in the right place there's some good slapstick and you have to admire the patience of filmmakers who are prepared to work with this many animals on one set
Once upon a time there was a promising young acting talent who went by the name of Owen Wilson
Mirthless family romp that hits all the lowest comedy dominators
Oh dear
Dogs may be for life but the memory of this film will last about  seconds
The incoherent moralising script demeans a number of actors including William H Macy Judy Greer and David Walliams reduced by a kindly editor to an ineffective cameo
Fans of the single-panel cartoon that has run in newspapers since the s will find plenty to disappoint them in this live-action adaptation
Better than Cats  Dogs but praise hardly comes much lower
There is only so much fun you can have with a talking dog and Marmaduke quickly exhausts the possibilities
Spectacularly sentimental full of ridiculous computer-animated action and makes sure its animals are a good deal less pallid than the humans on view
Marmaduke sinks to Beverly Hills Chihuahua levels of awfulness and only reaffirms that talking animals aren't funny -- they're boring
full review at Movies for the Masses
a gross mis-use of CGI animals
The plot's a total shambles The message rob pillage and snort your way to a no-consequences happy ending stinks
To be fair as Danny Dyer movies go Dead Man Running is better than average thanks to his likeable chemistry with Hassan and a lively if predictable plot
Dead Man Running feels like the last gasp of the Guy Ritchie dodgy deals and diamond geezers genre
Is there any way of stemming the flow of post-Guy Ritchie cockney crime comedies Would say sticking Danny Dyer's head on a pike somewhere in Bethnal Green be enough of a deterrent Because I for one would be willing to pay that price
This British gangster movie has nicked the style and plot of Lock Stock  Two Smoking Barrels well er lock and stock
Alongside football hooliganism mad cow disease and Joss Stone the modern British crime movie may be the export of which we're least proud
About as entertaining as a goalless draw at Accrington Stanley
It ticks all the right boxes for the Brit crime genre and won't disappoint fans of Guy Ritchie's oeuvre even if it lacks the flair that once made the latter's films so popular
The combined effect is amiable rubbish embodied by Dyer who continues to walk a tightrope between laughing stock and national treasure
Neither a total shambles or a triumph it should appeal to fans of the cockney crime genre Anyone else may find it a right pain in the Khyber
Without a steady build of tension  minutes ends up feeling like two hours More like Dead Man Plodding
It'll shift serious DVD units and is not as bad as it could have been
Dead Man Running feels like something cobbled together after a cynical producer saw Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and decided to cash in Except it is ten years too late
Too dark and cumbersome as a comedy too weak and unlikely as a drama this retro Ritchie wannabe has an eye-catching cast but can't decide between the cartoon and the kitchen sink
This budget-conscious simplistically plotted and often cringingly performed crime caper is not quite as inauspicious a producing debut as one might have expected
It has a quality cast but we've run round this track too many times while the script jogs from scene to scene without any surprises
The real issue is that these are all stock characters with nothing to say which leaves them feeling stiff and uninteresting
A little uncertain in tone but brisk and likely to go down well with the patrons of Albert Square's Queen Vic
If Guy Ritchie lost interest while making another cockney-geezer caper and tried to get himself sacked by deliberately turning in half-hearted work the result of his non-efforts might look something like this film
Hardly an unpleasant ride to take but this is ultimately the epitome of disposable entertainment
The film is hectoring enough to put the green movement back  years and you end up wondering how many trees have been felled and air-miles flown to make this abject excuse for slapstick comedy
Shields is not a natural comic performer to say the least Her face has the comic mobility and expressiveness of an Easter Island statue
One of those sad little movies upstaged by its own vastly superior trailer
There is an environmental message delivered along with the goofy mayhem involved in catching the fuzzy culprits But fair warning once inside the theater the audience is trapped
Seemingly written to the tastes of underachieving five-year-olds director Roger Kumble Cruel Intentions is hamstrung to create an even mildly entertaining children's comedy
Even by the low standards of live action funny animal movies Furry Vengeance is a pretty bad film the sort of low gag rate family flick that aims for generic suitable-for-all fun and satisfies no-one in the process
A feeble family comedy that really tests your patience
Furry a bit mangy
People often ask reviewers to choose the worst film of the year so far At last I have a cast-iron candidate
Fraser merece crditos pelo esforo e por no temer o ridculo Por outro lado isto no  desculpa para a atrocidade representada por este filme racista mal dirigido e sem a menor graa
Fraser's career may be dying hard with this vengeance
Oh the horror It's the writers who deserve to be sprayed by skunks for giving us this stinker
Oh the horror It's the writers who deserve to be sprayed by skunks for giving us this stinker
Is there really such a paucity of live-action family films on offer that Furry Vengeance needs a release at all
If there's an award for taking a great idea and strangling it to death with mediocre execution this should get it
Filled with pratfalls slapstick and toilet humour this furry nonsense with an eco-friendly message is harmless family fun
Almost as much of a relief as making it through to the end is realising earlier on that none of the creatures will be talking for the duration of the picture This reduces the annoyance factor considerably for anyone over the age of nine
Here is a film that doesn't just scrape the bottom of the barrel it demands that you lick it
That even the kids in the audience didn't really laugh at all the hyperactive mugging and slapsticky animal nonsense pretty much tells you what an excruciating -minute endurance test this is
Sooner or later you might be inclined to root for hapless predators like Sylvester the Cat or Wile E Coyote because they are the underdogs and their prey are far more obnoxious than they are
The presence of Danny Dyer meanwhile has likely tipped you off to the fact that it's a set in a world of Brit gangsters and b not very good
A good idea that unfortunately doesn't quite work thanks to poor direction and a script that's not as clever or as funny as it thinks it is
Simon Fellows and screenwriter Jayson Rothwell have come up with one of the worst ever ideas for a movie and created a cinematic abomination devoid of point humour and entertainment value
Alice's adventures lose something in their contemporary translation and there is very little to care about It's nicely shot though in the style of a s music video
Dyer has some funny lines and he makes the most of them proving that he is actually a good performer all too often marooned in endless geezer knees-ups But otherwise it's a bit pointless and heavy-handed
Despite a certain visual flair Malice in Wonderland just isn't very good The screenplay is the main problem - it's just too flat and unimaginative to justify the larger-than- life cartoon characters that populate the movie
Malice In Wonderland does little to remind you of the performances that once had critics and even the late great Harold Pinter crowing about his talent as Dyer started out on the West End stage
Quite apart from the fact that it mistakes sexism and homophobia for sardonic liberal rib-tickling even at  minutes the film feels like a brash crass and boneheaded music promo that's been stretched to breaking point
Genuinely original interpretation of the Brit gangster and Lewis Carroll's surreal tale
While you might expect a cheap quickie designed to cash in on the Tim Burton feature  Malice in Wonderland is actually an honest and at times intriguing updating of the classic set in modern times in the cockney underworld of South London
Sadly the funniest thing about this film is the cast list because filmmaker Forsberg simply doesn't have a clue how to put them to any use at all There's so much camp value that it's not even funny But it's not even remotely funny
A badly acted poorly written and ineptly directed mess with dreadful special effects
Played straight it's initially amusing but swiftly outstays its welcome as the piranhas develop the ability to fly like fanged double decker buses and the whole caboodly tries just a bit too hard to be knowing
Those who follow the so bad it's good school of thought will probably love it -- anyone else should avoid
There's about half an hour of watchable film in here The other hour is looping stock footage and endless scenes of people gawping at monitors
The designer-trashy tone is well sustained -- these people brought you Mega Shark versus Giant Octopus -- as the toothy threat moves from the Amazon to the Florida Keys
Bad-movie enthusiasts will doubtless have fun watching these oversized piscine predators leaping from the ocean and laying waste to Florida's coastal regions but hasn't this tiresome kitschy so-bad-it's-good fad run its course
Is it any good That's the wrong question to ask of a film like this whose many plot-holes absurdities and over-the-top idiocies are an essential part of the allure But is it bad enough
Everything about it is deliberately winkingly atrocious -- killing the fun for those like me who think unwitting schlock is the juiciest kind
It stars former pop queen Tiffany who topped the charts in  with I Think We're Alone Now Visit a cinema showing this and the chances are you'll know what she was singing about
Incredibly for a film which presumably intends to at least alarm an audience the budget seems to have been spent entirely on set-piece explosions with no money remaining for the actual fish
I can't think of anything more dispiriting than a film consciously faking it for the so-bad-it's-good market
An absolute stinker in every conceivable way
We can ridicule every frame
I surveyed the crowd at the screening I attended feeling the chill in the air as seven strangers sat in stone-cold silence -- not a single laugh from anyone The eighth moviegoer Fast asleep five minutes in I've never envied a person more
Lame vampire spoof has no bite
A no-stars no-plot no-point vampire spoof about a group of coeds studying abroad in a haunted castle Transylmania boasts the kind of acting and direction usually relegated to the adult section of your local video store
One laugh -- Vampires stuffed in their coffins on a horse-drawn wagon whining to the driver -- Are ve DERE yet
Parental Content Review
Spoofs horror cliches rather than stringing together random witless pop-culture gags like the Scary Movie franchise  but is vulgar juvenile gross and not particularly funny
Transylmania's characters are intensely irritating and its comedy is so obvious that you'll see the film's limp attempts at jokes coming a mile away
It has no artistic or social value and it contains not one genuine laugh
It's destined to spend a short and painful life in theaters and then join the ranks of the DVD and late-night-cable undead
Transylmania is such a colossal comedic misfire that it makes the execrable Scary Movie films look like masterworks of Preston Sturges-esque genius by comparison
If your idea of a good time is laughing with repulsion at a humpbacked Romanian nympho with a torture-loving midget dad or tittering every time a bong appears a darkened theater awaits you
Energetic but uninspired mix of teen comedy and supernatural silliness
With stronger actors and real writers this might've been a vintage comedy you could sink yournope not going there
Woefully dull-witted
David and Scott Hillenbrand's stoner horror-comedy predictably provides more groans than laughs The filmmakers had better pray someone in the theater is holding if you know what we mean
'Transylmania' LOOKS like a move It's on film after all and it has a script and actors But there the resemblance to any real movie ends This tasteless mess should have been shuttled straight to DVD
Fart jokes ensue
This is dinosaur stuff A rubber chicken and a squirting flower would've really capped things off
It's really bad but at least it's not Friedberg and Seltzer levels of bad
If nothing else Homecoming should effectively squelch any movie-star ambition on the part of Mischa Barton though the camera is more than usually attentive to her cleavage
Competent but unimaginative
A bizarre mash-up of Fatal Attraction and Stephen King's Misery with so many risible premises that it's hard to know where to begin
Homecoming is Exhibit A in how casting can make--or in this case break--a genre picture
Nothing in the film is truly laughably bad but then -- unlike this year's Obsessed -- nothing is campily entertaining either
Homecoming is coldly efficient for what it is But what it is is trash
An unmitigated B-movie that isn't thrilling enough or cheesy enough to make it worth the trip
Teen thrillerromance is gory but ho-hum Skip it
You can tell where this is all going and the familiarity wouldn't be so bad if this cast could have some fun with the cliches Alas these CW stars pout and frown and yell while lumbering and plodding through the Stephen KingRob Reiner playbook
A silly low-rent mash-up of Misery and Fatal Attraction featuring neither the clever psychology of the former nor the layers of emasculation and consequence of the latter
Everything including the ending plays out exactly as you'd expect
As ineffectual police work and broken feet stack up the silliness gets out of hand
Rooted by a nice sense of place but much like its real life namesake Homecoming isn't age-appropriate for everyone -- maybe just those in high school or barely removed Others will likely find the familiarity more humdrum than effectively nostal
When is a movie remake not a movie remake When the filmmakers involved know what they've made is so wretched they don't dare admit it The most oblivious MTV viewer won't miss the blatant plagiarism
The movie takes a premise that might have served as the basis of a weepy romantic drama and turns it into something very different but no less insulting
Neither trashy nor self-consciously funny enough to make its genre-trapped ludicrousness sing
Too lazy preposterous and inane to even be considered as a guilty pleasure
Rent Obsessed instead That one you can at least laugh at
there is so little new or innovative about it that if you're a normal moviegoer you've seen it all before
This ripoff of Misery will make you miserable Paul Chambers CNN
Crazy is just too tame for his own good
Looking and sounding like a second-tier 's made-for-cabler Crazy on the Outside is the sort of bland trifle one might watch to kill time during an extended flight
You'd think that getting Allen Sigourney Weaver JK Simmons Kelsey Grammer Jeanne Tripplehorn and Ray Liotta together for a comedy would be at the least intriguing but as it turns out not so much
Each actor appears to have received the script to a different movie while Allen adds his own directorial touch of sexual vulgarity
We get charmless hack work from two sitcom writers a phoned-in ensemble and for Allen a vanity role that could certainly be called criminal
Tim Allen's directorial debut a strained comedy drama about an ex-con trying to go straight isn't nearly crazy enough
Allen screws up his directing debut with a script that smothers his wit in a blanket of bland
This vanity project has the feel of an extended sitcom pilot
Allen's forced approach to Judd Pillot and John Peaslee's Screenwriting -style script has merely left everyone floating on their own
Terrible terrible
I just get bored thinking about it
Winds up as a fairly inspirational comedy without being truly memorable
This is imbecilic hooey of the rarest breed
This is easily the worst film of the year so far and frankly last year too It is embarrassingly painfully unfunny
Most repellent is the undercurrent of homophobia the brutal cultural stereotyping and the fact that Travolta looks like a man wearing a slightly melted rubber John Travolta Hallowe'en mask
The pickings are slim going on invisible
Dumb and painfully unfunny
At the screening I attended I didn't hear one person laugh though I did hear plenty of involuntary sighs and groans some of them emanating from myself
Old Dogs is a milestone in the Travolta's career the moment when he trumped Battlefield Earth to make the worst film of his life
It's perhaps wise to avoid this movie at all costs
A slapdash embarrassment of feeble age gags and cultural stereotypes Old Dogs is at once crass corny amateurish insulting uninspired deeply phoney and extraordinarily unfunny
You've never experienced horror until you've seen Robin Williams in a Speedo getting a spray tan
Travolta and Williams engage in a torrent of slapstick set-ups that are neither witty nor funny
Both Williams and Travolta mug furiously and the kids need locking up
The jokes are played painfully safe and not even the fleeting presence of a few a name faces detracts from the sheer inanity of the plot and outright creepiness of the film's central pairing
A trip to the vets is needed to have this dog of a movie quietly put down
It's aggressively awful and manages to push its worst gags so numbingly off the scale that we're left slack-jawed in disbelief
Um embarao para todos os envolvidos - inclusive o pblico
Featuring a mixed-up-medication gag a guy-in-a-gorilla-suit gag and a suntan-gone-wrong gagwell you begin to understand the level of inspiration that went into the execution of the film
John Travolta and Robin Williams are no strangers to shamelessness But not even they can walk away from Old Dogs with a shred of dignity - a mean-spirited insulting family film that essentially pees down its leg and calls it comedy
Heartless brainless and unable to do anything with what it does have to offer Old Dogs doesn't know who it's for or what it's offering It just needs to get made because people have to have something to do Spare yourself and your kids
A cringe-worthy crude comedy that has more bark than bite
An incoherent and frequently boring mess from beginning to end thanks to incompetent direction badly staged fight scenes a paper-thin plot and poor performances
Highly resistible
Despite a somewhat disappointing finale this is a must-see for extreme action fans
The ball games are so over-edited and CGI-embellished it's like watching a hardcore version of Quidditch
This is all about glistening pretty boys laying into each other in increasingly elaborate ways BASEketball this isn't
Fireball is a preposterously idiotic Thai movie about an illegal underground blood sport that mixes martial arts and er basketball to produce four incredibly long and hugely tedious fight sequences
The clunking storyline is a real drag and the movie is essentially hobbled because the nominal lead is a rock performer not a martial artist
This mostly routine Thai actioner mixes sports movie clichs martial arts moves melodramatic excess and gangster claptrap in the kind of movie Van Damme made in the 's
While the title refers to a rather outrageous game that mixes kickboxing with basketball this is actually a routine gangland thriller And it's directed in a style that prevents us from understanding the action or caring about the characters
The few women in the cast look aghast at what is going on
The plot is a pretext for nonstop bone-crushing mayhem of a mind-numbing kind
If fireball had an idealistic Jimmy Hill-style commentator he'd describe this film as a poor advertisement for the game
Is best when dealing with the splendors of the natural landscape
Kate Beckinsale adrift in a blizzard of cliches doesn't have enough star presence or her Stevie Nicks black leather vampire drag to keep audiences from drifting away Bland and predictable
The film's slick and expensive looking but dumber than a dead penguin
It's Kate Beckinsale on Ice
The misleading trailer suggests 'Nancy Drew vs the Thing' but this graphic-novel adaptation is more 'CSI Antractica' -- a straight if occasionally gruesome murder mystery boosted by the novelty of its sub-zero South Pole setting
a relatively mediocre by-the-numbers mystery thriller that melts from your mind as soon as you step into the sunlight
just predictable routine
I wasn't entertained I just wanted out of the supposed cold
The movie is as inert as the wintry terrain in which it is set
The film's biggest crime is that no obvious effort was made here everything flows with the rigidity of a check list of genre cliches and safe choices
Whiteout is a colorless wasteland There's only one thing that could have helped cover this film up A flashback that changed the script's name to Wite-Out
Needed Generic thriller in an exotic setting some gore possible sci-fi elements female lead and an older male star to play grizzled supporting character Must work cheap
it's painless Brainless too but not so much so that you want to throw a shoe at the screen
Okay it's far from the best murder mystery you've ever seen but I still can't help but liking this throwaway thriller The ending was no surprise Paul Chambers CNN
South Pole-set whodunnit is bloody but bland
If you'd forgotten that this title ever existed well so have I
Dominic Sena whose credits include 's 'Kalifornia' good and 's 'Swordfish' not so good can't seem to find anything new under the perpetually obscured sun
Whiteout isn't particularly bad but it does follow the thriller playbook step-by-step with only a little tweaking A lack of originality isn't the end of the world but it could have been so much better
When the snow starts blowing it's impossible to tell who's who and what's what Maybe parkas should be color-coded
Gallons of the titular correction fluid may have helped Dominic Sena's abysmal thriller if it had been applied at just about any juncture during the graphic novel-to-feature film script stage
It's of note chiefly for giving likeable performers not one worthwhile thing to do between them
A corny script and lifeless direction undermine what could have been a potentially enjoyable coming-of-age film about a young woman who thinks she has her life sorted out Despite the talented cast the film can only barely generate a smile
A badly written poorly directed and frequently excruciating comedy-drama that squanders both its talented cast and its potentially interesting premise
It's not a bad topic for a comedy especially in the current economic climate but the film-makers don't have the faintest idea what to do with it
Post Grad is trying to reproduce the wackily dysfunctional manners of family life that made Little Miss Sunshine a hit but hasn't the charm the jokes or significantly the nerve
While there's little to hate there's almost nothing to like in a film this anodyne The jokes aren't funny the performances are middling and the storyline predictable
The film is never flat-out terrible - just thoroughly bland
One bland listless slog
This lame family-centric comedy desperately wants to be Little Miss Sunshine but ends up - by virtue of the bizarre cast of unfunny characters - like Invasion of the Body Snatchers
The level of humour is summed up by the scene where a dead cat is buried in a pizza box
A clumsily scripted misfiring affair
he try-hard quirkiness and clunky screenwriting starts to grate after just a few minutes By the final act it's not unlike having bamboo splinters inserted under your fingernails
Vicky Jenson's attempt at a go-getting romcom is a tragic underachiever on the com front the rent-a-quirk characters feel like a Little Miss Sunshine tribute act gone wrong
There's certainly a lot of material there but none of the comedy works in any way at all and Keaton is a dead zone at the centre of the film
Director Vicky Jenson has infused Post Grad with all the subtlety and substance of a garden-variety sitcom
It acts like the audience knows nothing about how humans behave or find jobs or keep them or have romantic relationships or exist in families
Director Vicky Jenson has a sitcom script on her hands and proceeds accordingly
With a formulaic plot and uninspiring dialogue not even Mr Mom can help the film stay afloat
Like festive icing on a plain vanilla cake a fun cast and offbeat humor hugely increase the palatability of Post Grad
Ho-hum stuff
Whatever disturbed and previously untapped audience this is meant to find it's certainly novel
A film that looks as if it's been through  test screenings script drafts and reshoots each unfunnier and more muddled than the last
One of the ropiest would-be screwball comedies conceived recently
Mary is a memorable comic creation for all the wrong reasons glibly written offensively characterised and bizarrely dressed she's the classic screwball ditz taken to grotesque and at times unwatchable extremes
This deeply unfunny comedy misfires at every turn
It's baffling that some of our favourite actors would sign up for this slightly creepy desperately unfunny twaddle Don't encourage them by watching it
All About Steve is constructed as a romantic comedy but Mary's tireless stalker-like behavior suggests that this ought to be a horror film
A disappointingly disposable romantic comedy
The film's complete failure to engage on any level much less comedic lies entirely at the feet of Bullock
All About Steve is survivable You'll never see such passion for a crossword anywhere else
Let's say you're the kind of person who has a morbid curiosity for films that defy logic the ones that blow your mind with their badness Then I can wholeheartedly recommend you see this one
Just when it seems All About Steve couldn't grow any more insufferable it turns strangely sentimental
Fasten your seat belts it's going to be a bumpy review
It's so bad you might feel a little sorry for Bullock -- but don't take pity on her Watching All About Steve will only make you feel worse
Kooky Hardly Cringing Most assuredly
All About Steve is a messy assemblage of clumsy sight gags winking reaction shots and disingenuous populist genuflection to the idea that there's no such thing as normal We all see a little bit of Mary in ourselves don't we Don't we
On paper a crazy romcom starring Sandra Bullock and Bradley Cooper could only be a good thing Wrong
Bullock as both co-producer and star makes sure All About Steve sparkles with easy laughs
A head-scratcher of a comedy starring the increasingly enigmatic Sandra Bullock
Mary's supposed to be a plucky free spirit but mostly she's a chatty bore who's emotionally clueless
Beyond a Reasonable Doubt feels like some throwaway s TV movie with its implausible premise dizzying twists cheesy montages and melodramatic score
Like its title Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is a generic forgettable courtroom thriller
What I can't figure out is how director Peter Hyams can remake a  movie from the great Fritz Lang and not learn anything about suspense pacing and storytelling in the process
An undercooked crime flick whose real mystery is why it was made
Despite excellent stunt work and a too-brief appearance by Orlando Jones as an unflappable cop the movie -- unlike Mr Douglas's hairdo -- never rises above mediocrity
I've got no problem with movies that stack up twists like crazy straws Hyam's script however depends on us being dumber than every character in the film-you'd have to reach protozoan levels just to resist wanting to strangle everyone in it
There are plenty of reasonable doubts about his mediocre legal thriller remake
The leads can't lend either spunk or gravitas to what was already a preposterous yarn  years ago
What you won't be able to figure out is why this laughable yarn didn't go straight to DVD
Preposterous asinine poorly edited and downright silly with more unintentional humor than your average courtroom thriller
There's fun to be had in a rickety Coney Island rollercoaster manner and it's not terrible late at night on the couch with a bag of warm popcorn though it is just too silly and slight for all its bluster
There's little in this pointless rehash to distract audiences from the pleasure of watching Tamblyn a fine young actress whose direct grownup stare belies her baby features
A good rule to follow for wannabe gritty thrillers Lead actors shouldn't remind you of late-night informercial pitchmen
Comes across as more s TV movie than s period piece
The result is at times genuinely suspenseful  and if the final twist doesn't drive you crazy the cleverness may win you over
While the original is perhaps not a faultless classic it certainly offers more excitement and competence than the star of John Tucker Must Die and the director of A Sound of Thunder can offer
Conscientiously creepy but with a finale just too rushed to correlate with what preceded before Though Metcalfe isn't bad in commanding viewer attention as well as he does his tool in Desperate's random bulked for booty housewife gardens
grows more preposterous as it unfolds
Hyams takes a perfectly good story and kills it with logic loopholes inconsistent character behavior horrendous headache-inducing cutting and a number of brainless chase scenes
an entertainingly absurd thriller that boasts several genuinely exciting interludes and an expectedly riveting performance from Michael Douglas
The supernatural is the hobgoblin of the titular doubting Thomas in The Skeptic though judging by writer-director Tennyson Bardwell's hapless mood shifts in this tepid horror-comedy it seems consistency of tone deserves even less credibility
A mechanical compendium of anti-skepticism clichs right down to the obligatory post-realization upchuck
Too tepid to ever get your heart racing and too simple to engage the mind
Bardwell writes and directs carefully though without inspiration leaving open the question of whether the house is really haunted
I'll take a bunch of teenagers terrorized by chain-saw-wielding zombies any day
Tennyson Bardwell's pretentious psycho-supernatural flick doesn't even qualify as guilty-pleasure camp It's the sort of bad movie that will make you lose faith in the genre altogether
This old-fashioned psychological ghost story  repeatedly compels supposedly mature and intelligent people to do preposterous things in order to keep the plot moving
Polished but dull
While horror movies have become tedious fare relying on recycled gotcha scare tactics this brainteaser blend of the logical psychological and psychic aims to keep viewers on their toes as well as at the edge of their seats
A film with good ideas and performances but weak predictable two-dimensional frustrating dialogue
You know you're in trouble when the most appealing element your film is Tom Arnold
Old-fashioned in the worst sense Bardwell's ghost story is heavy on Freud light on fear
Think of Shirley Valentine and take away charm wit realism and Pauline Collins
The film is sweet and has a jolly holiday feel but is sadly let down by Nia's unfunny acting
Turgid sappy and utterly failing to utilise a cast including Richard Dreyfuss it's bad enough to make you smash plates over your own head
It's like Mamma Mia without the songs wit and charm or Shirley Valentine after a full frontal lobotomy
It's a bit like ouzo seems like fun at the time but you'll no doubt regret it in the morning
Vardalos' peppy charm and the postcard scenery make for pleasant diversions but there's no getting away from the script's mawkishness
While Vardalos does her big fat best to keep it fresh the duff characters and uninspired direction make Greece look as appealing as a week-old kebab
The film and all its characters are as tacky and charmless at the end as they are on first impressions
Feeble romantic comedy
Feels like its been churned out by some auto-plot generator
As the end of the road finally draws near you'll need to pull over and throw up
Hollywood doesn't know what to do with difference any more than it does with ruins It's about time Vardalos or someone gave the suits a guided tour
Nia Vardalos is as charming and watchable as ever but this is cliche ridden fluff
Leave it to Hollywood to take a bad idea and make it terrible
Vardalos is fine but Petrie and writer Mike Reiss yoke her to an ossified formula in which various national stereotypes and the character actors who play them embarrass themselves in bazaars and at Greek temples
My Big Fat Greek Coach Full of Clichs
The story is loaded with cliches and weak characters that are simply too annoying to handle
As a tour guide Georgia rates as average as a movie star Vardalos rates much the same
A cloying romantic comedy
With its portrait of cranky uninterested tourists rowdy Aussies fat Yanks dingy hotels shady merchants and busted buses Ruins feels like somebody's personal vendetta against the travel industry
Though it's a near thing the movie isn't quite bad enough to qualify as a classic tone-deaf vanity production
This Friday the th Los Angeles vanity release isn't even fun in a bad-movie way
It's clear from Polanski's cramped frames that director Chapa knows as little about filmmaking as he does his subject
A jumbled whorish opportunistic hot mess multi-hyphenate Chapa's film is a fantastically terrible biopic poorly told and riddled with repeated confounding lapses in logic
Ambitious in an obsessive stalkerish sort of way Damian ChapaTMs low-budget biopic of Roman Polanski is avowedly empathetic and thus not a complete hatchet job
To describe the film as this generation's Wired hardly begins to scratch the surface This is a movie so bad that the people who actually made Wired can actually look down upon it without coming across as hypocritical
There should be a law that forces potential renters of Grave to be sent Long Weekend insteadonce you've watched the original slow-burn its way into a frenzy the misguided remake from Blanks just looks all the more insipid
Nature's Grave violates one of the first rules of remakes - if you're not going to be as good or try to improve on what came before you really shouldn't bother
the perfect remedy for one of those bright cheerful days when all you want to do is sulk and skulk
Nature's Grave isn't worth wasting words on It's Grand Theft Cinema a pointless artless clone that serves no purpose
I had no sympathy for the charcters They are at their core wretched people who deserve to have their relationship fall apart
The boys directed and co-scripted so there's no one else to blame
It's a strange irony that any movie aimed squarely at an allegedly adult audience usually features enough gags involving feces and urine to delight six-year-olds for hours
Shockingly second-rate and relentlessly unfunny
Abysmal laugh-free and frequently offensive comedy whose one or two original ideas are completely overshadowed by smutty puerile gags and a plot that's so insultingly sexist that you wonder if it's part of an elaborate prank
This comedy might be the Worst Movie Ever Seen even with the aftershock of the Wayans Bros' Dance Flick still lingering
A dire gross-out comedy that tackles many of the same themes as Adventureland but without an ounce of subtlety or wit
So moronic that even plankton would tut at its ignorance
Cregger is so dull that it might be an improvement if he slipped back into a coma
A teen sex comedy that isn't sexy or comic - talk about dumb and dumber
Pure eye-poking boob-baring raunch that will tickle your inner idiot and wind up everyone else something rotten
Nothing works Nothing comes close to working Even other people's ideas that work in their own films don't work here
An almost perfect atrocity It is a towering K of bobbins the most mangy noxious charmless sexist racist unfunny infantile stomach-turning grotesque clueless inept and stupid film of the year
A whiff of what I can only describe as pure evil billows off the screen while this comedy is playing a buddy grossout picture with zero laughs and a persistent chilling misogyny
Miss March must be a contender for worst film of the year It's so poor that you begin to suspect it's a pastiche
If this film were as racist as it is sexist which it very nearly is it would be a buddy movie about the madcap antics of two Klan members on a lynching spree Appalling If we could give it zero out of five we would
A crude crass virtually laugh-free sex comedy
Some of the lewdest unfunniest jokes ever made and at the end one feels in need of a stiff drink a hot shower and a lesson in selective amnesia
At its best this lewder cruder spin on last year's Sex Drive has a disarmingly daffy shaggy-dog touch a la Half-Baked or The Brothers Solomon But by the time a woman enjoys champagne spiked with dog urine Miss March is all turn-offs
The movie's over-use of poop and pee is further evidence of its desperation
Definitely worth seeing if you like a good gross-out film sex comedy
A witless send-up of pop-culture detritus like light sabers Batmobiles and Hasta la vista baby
You'd have to have X-ray vision to find a semblance of a plot here yet you'd have to be blind to overlook the cheapness of the special effects and the ineptitude of the direction
Super Capers doesn't ever come close to justifying its existence
Nothing here works
This first feature by Ray Griggs wears its Mad Magazine influences like a badge of honor but fails to round up enough laughs to save the day
Intended as a campy riff on comic-book antics Super Capers is instead a monumental negative achievement a super catastrophe
A bizarrely misguided attempt to revive -- and spoof -- the classic B-movie Super Capers is the kind of experience that makes you want your  minutes back
Featuring the production values of a commercial for a local used-car dealership in Cedar Rapids Iowa Super Capers is a pathetic grab bag of spoofs
The first  minutes of this mirthless mess was interminable and it didn't get any better I'd feel cheated if I'd rented this one from the red box at Mickey D's
Too much of the time though is wasted with moronic shenanigans and B-level acting by a cast that was obviously hired because they were affordable
Super Capers begins as a campy tribute to comic book heroes and their s and 's TV incarnations but quickly descends into an ineptly paced toothless lampoon of sci-fi and fantasy films
Superhero comedy is age appropriate but only so-so
The movie's only strength is the fabulous comic bookMAD magazine cartoon imagery by humorous illustrator Tom Richmond
Brutally stupid consistently mistakes wholesale theft -- from beloved geek favorites from Star Wars to Back to the Future to The Matrix -- for creative cleverness
Even if you manage to suspend your disbelief and to check your brain at the door Super Capers still feels lazy dull painfully juvenile and void of any real thrills laughs or even unintentionally funny moments
A woefully toothless send-up of superhero silliness Indeed Super Capers is in need of its own creative rescuing
Slower than a glacier at the South Pole More powerful than the strongest insomnia cure Able to empty theaters with a single frame It's a turkey It's a Hindenburg It's Super Capers
This latest take on Bush-era paranoia and cell phone alarm might arrive in theaters somewhat dramatically moldy and short-sheeted in the budget department yet it's actually a more rewarding sit than Eagle Eye if viewed with minimal attention paid
Echelon Conspiracy is a pale imitation of Eagle Eye not exactly a good movie to begin with
Presumably it was the fact that the DVD release schedule for the week was already filled that explains the escape of this picture to theatres--it really belongs on a video store shelf or a late-night slot on a non-premium cable network
Echelon Conspiracy is a more evocative title than a movie this stupid deserves
A by-the-numbers international thriller in the Bourne vein
The biggest mystery is how this high-tech whodunit-gone-awry got a theatrical release and didn't go directly to dvd
Of all the pejorative words that could be used to describe this film perhaps the most apt is amateurish
Simply a case of we've-seen-this-before-and-better at least Sandra Bullock's The Net had camp value Conspiracy flimsily masquerades as a ticking bomb but is ultimately sans heart-pounding jolts
The movie isn't so much outright bad as it is simply flat and routine
When the only elements that could be called professional are the photography and the poster art you can consider this a movie only the producer's mother could love
In the right hands this premise might a good movie make -- a fable like Aladdin's lamp updated for the iPhone era This convoluted and half-baked conspiracy thriller does not
Combines a righteous message about out-of-control government surveillance with the old computer-gone-haywire plot to make - well not very much actually
The Unborn isn't the worst horror film you'll see in  but the prospect of a sequel which the film teases at the finale is probably the biggest fright in the  minutes
This foolish film hitches an easy ride from the Holocaust
Cue a creepy toddler various demonically possessed adults and a Jewish exorcism conducted by Gary Oldman He's a vastly better actor than the film deserves but he can't make the script seem even slightly better than it is
After a few initial decent scares the corny dialogue poor casting and cringe-worthy acting drag this movie into it's own hell Utter rubbish
Some of the ideas here may seem original if questionable but the treatment -- by writer-director David Goyer -- is strictly conventional with the shock moments obviously inserted at regular intervals usually while the heroine is in her underwear
Full of cheap thrills that mostly consist of people popping up out of nowhere and dialogue comprised largely of theological gobbledygook
'Tis the season of the Hollywood dumps -- which is too bad because I had harbored some small hope for this latest horror offering from David S Goyer
The Unborn is a story that should have remained untold and will be forgotten by the end of the weekend
The Unborn is like a scary movie sentence without the necessary linking verbs It's all genre gears and no motivational motor
boasts few attributes designed to initially capture the viewer's interest
There is a senseless scare every - minutes Now after one or two you start to get the giggles but after the third or fourth false scare you begin to Laugh Out Loud
What The Unborn represents manages to be a thousand times more disturbing than anything Goyer captured with his pen or camera
Should have been aborted
The best that can be said for Goyer's latest is that it's competent How competent is a matter of debate as is the degree to which Goyer is self-aware about the film's camp value Blu-ray
The Unborn is packed full of grisly images and effects but its apparent attempts to be some kind of Jewish take on The Exorcist fail miserably
An exuberantly creepy mash-up of Jewish folklore J-horror atmospherics and demonic possession boilerplate
Smoking-hot heroine Clever paranormal premise Painfully clueless conclusion
Unoriginal unbelievable utterly unwatchable
I kept hoping Oldman would revert to his Sid  Nancy punk persona and kick the little freak in the yarbles like some pain-deserving Springsteen fan but no such luck
I truly truly recommend watching either of those instead of The Unborn Or your wall Just staring at your wall is also an acceptable alternative too
If you thought they couldn't possibly make a Street Fighter movie that was worse than the  Jean-Claude Van Damme camp-fest you'll be unpleasantly surprised
I'm not making this up I happened to walk out of the three behind three guys One of them said to the others 'Did you PAY to see that'
Another video game transferred to the big screen with only so so results
It seems to work hard at not being fun
Not only is this a strong early contender for worst film of the year it could well be a candidate for the worst film ever made
Generic action sequences bad acting cringe-inducing dialogue and a miscast leading lady all combine for a thoroughly painful hour and a half at the movies
A long slog with little payoff
Proving that there's no statute of limitations on lousy ideas director Andrzej Bartkowiak's attempted franchise expansion returns to the Capcom motherlode that produced the worst movie in the entire Jean-Claude Van Damme filmography
The Legend of Chun-Li is as vapid and dull as it is
Just a boring bad action movie - which to be fair means that it's one of the best video game adaptations ever made
Devoid of a single redeeming feature the motley flick is a hodge-podge of chop-socky cliches -- a ball of flaming stinky martial arts chi
if there's anything legendary on display it's the performance of co-star Chris Klein which can only be described as epic in its awfulness
There will never be a good video game movie no matter how many stars pop up to headline them
Singularly witless
No mojo in its dojo
This sloppy second attempt at bringing the Street Fighter franchise to the big screenviolates one of the primary rules for any Playstation to motion picture translation - never mess with the mythology
Street Fighter fans like me will be blissfully playing Street Fighter IV with this movie occupying our minds as little more than a disposable curiosity
ultimately fares worse than its eye-rollingly campy  predecessor
Trades in vital game info to squeeze in as much acrobatics and fighting sequences as possible Bartkowiak shouldn't have taken the first part of the title so literally
This painful background tale of the schoolgirl master of the really slow fireball attack almost makes one yearn for the days of Jean-Claude Van Damme
It's a spineless careless bizarrely unadventurous number two that would rather saddle up and rehash Kelly's original screenplay over any clear-cut attempt to cook up some juicy oddities of its own
a thick viscous sludge of clichs stereotypes and poorly written dialogue
It wants to echo the original but can't figure out the rhythms
The entire project seems to sweat from the exertion of its writer Nathan Atkins and director Chris Fisher to do something-anything-to make the film worthwhile
I love Donnie Darko It is ominous funny replete with  well-observed moments S Darko is a callous attempt to cash in on its well-earned appreciation
It's been reported that Richard Kelly has completely disowned this movie and for good reason
This 'Donnie Darko Tale' is all style no substance - a superficial imitation that retraces the original's twists and turns but offers none of its own
Eighty-eight minutes and  seconds of pure unadulterated piffle
A funny self-consciously frothy piece of good-natured escapism
There's a good deal of potential squandered in this strained comedy which suffers from lazy writing miscalculated acting perfunctory directing and general bad timing
Bride Wars makes Sex and the City seem like Jane Austen
A paean to friendship and conspicuous consumption that is just simply wrong On a number of levels
Shrill and shallow 'Bride Wars' would make anyone wince at the thought of matrimony
Don't bother to RSVP to Bride Wars
A movie best left at the altar
Often unimaginative asinine and bland even if you're willing to check your brain at the door and suspend your disbelief for  minutes
You want to see Anne Hathaway in a worthy vehicle Check out Rachel Getting Married You want to see Kate Hudson in a worthy vehicleRent a time machine
If Bride Wars is any indication of what's to come please let last year linger a little longer
the leading ladies don't provide any memorable moments other than the obvious visual gag of a cat fight between two women in wedding dresses
The movie shows that life can be messy and how unrealistic it is to expect everything to be perfect on the biggest day in a girl's life
There are no pleasant surprises in this partly-Boston-shot Gary Winick film
It's a movie that mistakenly believes that we should want to like these people
Enough to make one yearn for the comparatively rich complexity of Home Improvement
It's like the Whack-a-Mole of everything reasonable people hate about so-called 'chick flicks' Blu-ray
reptilian hateful stuff biologically engineered to disrespect--with maximum efficiency--the precise demographic to which it targets itself
Bride Wars renders its women characters as stereotypes only capable of approaching the world the way a character from a prime-time TV show might
Bride Wars will ensnare the fairer sex like an evil goddamn tractor beam and there's nothing you can do about it If you must go see it take a book Or some cyanide
A series of sour notes
This ersatz Swingers attempts to tap into the male psyche as represented by a pair of one-note losers played by Freddie Prinze Jr and Chris Klein but the self-absorbed film keeps playing the same talky refrain
Doesn't break enough rules of the mid-'s Sundance coming-of-age buddy template to bring any new insights to the bonds of male friendship
Prinze's limited range as an actor drags down a spirited performance by Klein but the script is too awful to give either of them much hope
a well-intentioned effort
Possesses a poorly explored but fecund meta-analysis of juvenile semi-stardom that demands a more sensitive treatment
The reason this  drama has languished for so long could be that it's a bromance whose moment has only now arrived more likely it's because Frank Whaley's lightweight slice of life is so crashingly ordinary
The movie is a character study about two underachieving dullards scarcely worth contemplating
The overgrown boys at its center are so unappealing that the setting certainly won't make their trials worth your time
One of those pointless indies that you'll have forgotten before the credits roll
Suffers from mediocre performances and a contrived and silly screenplay that ultimately makes it falls flat as a drama comedy and satire
Uninspired performances and a lack of chemistry fail to project whatever has brought and kept the film's odd couple together
The contrast is inviting the emotional momentum is there and the dramatic situations are ripe with potentialand then the viewer is faced with Klein Prinze Jr and Sigler doing all the heavy lifting How deflating
I've read fortune cookies that were scarier not to mention smarter and more interesting
'The Haunting of Molly Hartley' left me as disappointed as a youngster who receives a box of raisins at every house on hisher trick-or-treat route
As it races from one unlikely trauma to the next for poor Molly the movie forgets one key thing The devil is in the details
It's no Rosemary's Baby but for teens looking for a quick fix on All Hallow's Day it will do
It would take hallucinations of a powerful kind indeed to find anything worthwhile in The Haunting of Molly Hartley a dead-on-arrival thriller that resolutely fails to come to life
It's a horror film better suited for skittish cats than humans
God and Satan duke it out for the soul of a young girl in The Haunting of Molly Hartley an unexpectedly cynical addition to the teen-scream genre
The Haunting of Molly Hartley isn't the least bit haunting It's just cheap
If you get past the retro Nancy Drew title this is a worthwhile effort
A more accurate title would have been The Annoying Flashbacks of Molly Hartley or Molly Hartley's Possibly Genetic Mental Disorder or even Molly Hartley's Series of Super-Sucky Unfortunate Events
The Haunting of Molly Hartley sort of an updated Rosemary's Baby for teens sucks most of the suspense out of its own suspense-thriller before the story even gets going
The acting in Haunting is cardboard as can be and although Bennett tries hard to engage us sheTMs seemingly interchangeable with any number of teen actresses currently roaming the airwaves at the CW
Story about the devil's daughter that is poorly written but well acted
What transpires is everybody's guess and all of it leads to what may take the blue ribbon for the least exciting climax ever to festoon a horror picture
almost as inept as the movie's advertising campaign which gives away the 'surprise' ending on the posters
I can't believe that Freestyle actually got this movie to be released in the theaters It's dull boring and at best laughably bad
Why do filmmakers bother Are they crazy Are we crazy And if not why do we keep paying  to see the same movie again
A watered-down version of prior better films 'The Haunting of Molly Hartley' is as dumb as a box of Halloween candy
an entirely forgettable and utterly lightweight horror endeavor
A contemptible cross between To The Devil a Daughter and a dark version of High School Musical without the music
A real movie disaster
With cheesy special effects even the volcano isn't convincing considering the film cost  million and a hole-ridden script this film offers precious little to like
Appalling
starts running out of entertainment value pretty early and continues on fumes until it sputters to a close
The eruption when it finally comes is a wonderfully cheesy amalgam of wobbly back projection bathtub tidal wave and scared expressions from the cast It's not as hilariously awful as Swarm or Meteor though which is a pity
inevitably derivative and the faux-American accents from the mostly Irish cast grate but it makes for a heady enough cocktail
Routine surgery
Paddy Breathnach's second horror outing plays much like his first mixing genres and influences into a heady cocktail - although this time around the flavours may no longer satisfy the jaded palate
Slasher movies tend to be all about the fiend doing the carving and cutting in a search for revenge And that's pretty much the core of Red Mist
You've seen this all before and you've seen it done better
The plot is total rubbish and no amount of slick film-making can make you believe it is worth all the blood and gore we have to sit through
Red Mist is a lazy incoherent shocker with nothing to recommend it
It isn't scary enough or funny enough to be worth your time
This is a by-the-numbers slasher dressed up as a thriller with Holby City-level acting
Beep beep wooooooo this moronic medical horror's so awful you'll be willing yourself to flatline
A very ordinary conventional by-the-numbers creepfest without any dark spark
A derivative and titter-inducingly weak slasher movie
'Shrooms' director Paddy Breathnach still hasn't the foggiest idea of how to make a horror
Romantic comedies don't always have the strongest concepts but Everybody Wants to Be Italian begins with what barely qualifies as an idea
Beantown provides a salty backdrop but when the action shifts to Italy it seems the budget didn't include airfares
It's pretty obvious Everybody Wants to Be Italian wants to be the next My Big Fat Greek Wedding Unfortunately it doesn't have nearly as much charm as the  sleeper In fact Italian doesn't have much charm to it at all
How atrocious is the comedy Everybody Wants to Be Italian Let me count the ways
With a title like this shouldn't Jason Todd Ipson's comedy celebrate Italian culture Instead it aggressively insults the heritage it pretends to admire
The film plays out pretty much exactly as you would expect -- which won't bother some people one iota
Constructed out of tired jokes vaguely familiar actors and a few forced and predictable situations it's strictly a harmless place-filler
Full of clunky humor battle-of-the-sexes musings and spicy accordion music Everybody Wants to Be Italian is relentless -- but not necessarily relentless fun
Writer-director Jason Todd Ipson's romantic comedy is so awash in tired ethnic clichs that the story drowns
A box of cannoli long past its sell-by date
The film is a reminder why romantic comedies have died off so much in recent years
Sets up hackneyed relationships conflicts and resolutions with such a lack of imagination and subtlety that paying attention to narrative particulars quickly becomes a waste of time
If you thought the ethnic stereotyping in My Big Fat Greek Wedding was bad this charmless romantic comedy will drive you to despair
A dreadful romantic comedy with totally unappealing characters
This lame-brain romantic comedy strives hard for a shambling charm but is unlikely to prove appealing to even the most undemanding of audiences
This particular film surely straddles the line between 'romp' and 'zany' and maybe even deserves that most hallowed of accolades 'zany romp'
Instead of making a likeable main character the filmmakers give us the egotistical brash rude and obnoxious character of Jake
It's all a bit offbeat and as a consequence we are more than ready to chuckle and open up our hearts
While not being entirely original or clever in its exploration of modern Italian culture it's a light-hearted film which delivers just enough giggles to keep it upbeat and kind of cute
A clarification is in order Nobody wants to be these Italians
Jane and Joe's rejuvenated love can conquer many things including mentally impaired country folk but it just can't save this unfortunate film
A moody thriller about an unhappily married couple a remote cabin and a pair of homicidal crazies
Entirely improvised and shot with multiple vid cameras in a single day Invisible is an ambitious experiment that alas is more intriguing as a concept than as a completed pic
The trouble with Adam Watstein's indie Invisible is that it isn't - invisible that is
The film looks as if it was shot in more than one day but Watsein's experiment in terror is a futile one
Crude boorish comedy doesn't make the grade
With sloppy direction a half-baked script and no reason to care College is far from being the Animal House of this generation
Sadistic with no laughs to be had
A movie that glorifies binge drinking flunks as a movie
makes The House Bunny look like The Importance of Being Earnest
A raunchy comedy that plays like a Superbad without the smarts the heart the originality or the laughs
Personally I wouldn't waste a  drink on this one but I do understand that teen's irritation
Legendary Animal House king of debauchery John Bluto Blutarsky would not approve of the party lifestyle at this College
A tedious by-the-numbers raunch-fest that exists strictly because it can
Excruciatingly unfunny
Not only would I not see this movie I wouldn't see any movie playing in the same multiplex
I thought it was dreadful from start to finish
If you hear someone deriding Superbad for being unoriginal or derivative sit them in front of College If they can't tell the difference they're a lost cause
The worst gags in Old School and Revenge of the Nerds are still superior to anything you'll see in College
a male fantasy of what sorority life is really like with a depth of story that would be more at home in a porn film than a major motion picture
So full of nastiness and cruelty that it's hard to believe anyone would find joy in it
A laugh-free thoroughly unpleasant comedy
We've done the whole classless college comedy thing before many times
If college were really like this everyone would drop out and found Microsoft
College is painfully stale pathetically unfunny and I can't think of a single reason why you should sit through it
If Kassovitz really believed he had a classic in the making why didn't he take a stand and nix the casting of Diesel while he had the chance
With a messy storyline and screenplay to boot the film feels disjointed and lacking true punch
With his face like a squashed doughnut and physique like the tyres of a huge truck Diesel just doesn't inhabit the same planet as Rampling or even Kassovitz himself
Whatever happened to Mathieu Kassovitz the French actor director whose amazing film La Haine made such an impact  years ago
Strap yourself in for some pure violence and stupidity
As if the gruff dialogue isn't bad enough the action scenes are merely adequate
This occasionally lavish often clunky venture is consistently watchable if not terribly memorable or distinctive
I call it sneeringly natch the 'New Nihilism' but to be fair it's really just the old Franco-Prussian existential angst hole ratcheted up and dumbed down for our not so brave new world
I unfortunately had a seat that faced the screen and I have two hours of my life that I will never get back
Skip it aggressively
With bland protagonists and power figures unpleasant enough for us to want them out of our sight more than we want them defeated it doesn't do much to hold our interest

There are moments here that are spectacular and there are many more that are spectacular failures
A joyless mess of a movie
Violent actioner is dull dreary and defective
To put it bluntly Babylon AD is a cluttered mess Characters have been under developed realtionships have no chemistry and its conclusion feels rushed and leaves too many unresolved questions
Ultimately Babylon AD is more of an advertisement for an extended and fixed cut than an outright failure
Despite all its noise and bluster this big-budget blockbuster is actually a rather slight dystopian sci-fi thriller
Babylon AD is a plodding incoherent fiasco though an oddly compelling one
The movie has a nice look -- gray rusted metal exposed to Siberian and Bering Strait snow What it lacks is coherence and a compelling reason for us to take this often-abrupt journey with Aurora Toorop and Sister Rebeka
This one may have oozed on over into September but it's every bit as bad as the previous month's studio-floor sweepings
Ominous maybe but never dangerous
This is as stale as Tuesday's Phad Thai from its exhausted mythos of the surgically efficient omnipotent hit man to the training scenes in which Joe explains the trade to the new guy to the inevitable betrayals of the third act
Cage is believable as the brooding lone-wolf gunman but the hit man screwing himself by growing a conscience on his final kill ploy needs to be put down for good
Neutered but pretty and lacking any real development this is the cinematic equivalent of a eunuch whose voice unfortunately broke pre-castration
Not to be a contrarian but as predictable as the movie is its events often feel as if there were no alternative The Pang brothers besides being artisans of action and suspense tell a good story -- or maybe I'm simply suffering from heat and Hurricane
Nicolas Cage parece determinado a sabotar a prpria carreira e muitos outros atores j teriam em seu lugar sido rebaixados a produes lanadas diretamente em DVD
It's garbage Cage better be careful If he keeps this up he'll wind up just like Val Kilmer doing straight to DVD junk
A perfectly uninvolving tale of errors acknowledged and manhood proved
The film isn't overtly heavy-handed in its violence but it doesn't provoke enough surprises to keep the mind from drifting -- a poison pill for an action film
Tediously monotonous
Cage is funless scowly grim and steroidally impervious to the fleshy and salacious good cheer that surrounds him
The burnt out assassin shtick is old and tired
o Nicolas Cage na periferei tis ektos eleghoy sapoynoperikes toy moytes kai ti geloia malloyra toy se ena pompodi poiitikistiko ahtarma poy bromaei ap' opoy ki an ton piaseis
A by-the-numbers retread that's ill-conceived as an action vehicle for Cage
While the film includes several exciting creatively shot action scenes the drama is otherwise so shopworn that the violent climax is a relief
Between all the dates and dinners Bangkok almost ends up being as less thriller and more travelogue by the hour mark there are literally more gulps than gunshots
This has the look of a cheap quickie foreign film not unlike a Hong Kong action film
At six foot plus with his hair-plug mullet and his ice-white teeth Cage sticks out like a sore thumb among the tiny Thai citizens making for the most conspicuous hitman since Agent  rocked the bald head 'n' barcode combination
A promising film about a hit man that ultimately gets wacked because its star isn't suited for the role at all
Pointlessly rancid and redundantHopefully Disaster Movie will indeed vanish as quickly as a three-second burp at a chili-eating contest
Can't somebody make Friedberg and Seltzer stop
If Judd Apatow is the Jesus of modern comedy Seltzer and Friedberg are the Anti-Christ - and sadly just as prolific
A woman a few rows in front of me at the preview chose to write  minutes worth of text messages rather than watch the movie Even though she was not paying the price was clearly too high
Since they have so little material to work with in the first place Friedberg and Seltzer flog each joke well beyond its limits
Honestly if the makers of this ever got serious about making web-based comedy I reckon that they would absolutely rock it
A dumb dumb film to be sure but also undeniably funny in more spots than a right-thinking mature adult person feels comfortable admitting
The jokes are limp and pathetic or stillborn timing is ignored performances are a not-so-giddy mug-fest Audiences are left wondering when the freshman cast is going to learn the rudiments of performing
Indeed a disaster first and a movie barely
It's a merry reckless mess like a blender that gets revved up too high and spews everything out all over the countertops
A poorly staged entirely laugh-free big screen exercise that despite its name is not really a genre spoof at all but rather merely an excuse to attempt to poke fun at Hollywood movies from this calendar year
Rarely has a movie had a more appropriate title
A budget-less pastiche of sub-Mad-magazine parodies culled from the trailers of almost every summer movie
Disaster Movie is one doo-doo that can't be undid homeskillet
It's juvenile and crude and it ranks right up there as one of the worst films of the year
This might have been edited down to  minutes of entertaining film Maybe one day the team involved will start employing editors and produce something we can all look forward to
There's no nice way to say this so I'll just say it Writerdirectors Friedberg and Seltzer are a scourge They're a plague on our cinematic landscape a national shame a danger to our culture
Disaster Movie is the latest and most slap-dash of the movie parodies to atrophy out of the Scary Movie franchise
The pomposity of big-budget B-movies can certainly be taken down a notch but Friedberg and Seltzer rely too much on trailer moments for their broad comedy
Depressingly these magpie parodies are so cheap to produce they can't fail to make money -- which probably means this interminable franchise is far from over
limp and rambling picture which crawls across the screen for about  minutes longer than it has any need to
I couldn't think of a less appealing advert for the way of the surf
A lackluster vanity production
A total wipeout
A shapeless slog with virtually no tale to chase
There's something about the mystical-spiritual aura surrounding surfing that tends to turn most movies on the subject to hippie-dippie mush
Willie and ganja yes yes the cliches abound
Surfer Dude is a bizarre throwback It feels - years out of date and seems to be meant to be watched on VHS oops make that DVD while stoned
Yes this is a movie made by stoners for stoners
You can stick around for the only funny line which involves a breakfast burrito but the smart surfer would head for the hills and Willie's goat ranch
The movie is about a surfer dude sans comma who is an analog dude trying to fit into a digital world which is like trying to get a square peg into a Calabi-Yau Manifold which is to say it probably won't work and neither does this movie
A hapless laughless movie
I wish the finished product was as amusing as the behind-the-scenes pot-fueled merriment I imagine took place during production
The number of artistically successful surfing movies can be counted on one hand and the majority of those are documentaries
It felt like we were watching a rough cut
The film looks more like a collection of home movies as opposed to a professional piece of cinema
A celebration of unrealistic lifestyles which makes it exactly the wrong film for our times Blu-ray
The problem that Surfer Dude faces is that in its attempt to be a stoner comedy it forgot to add the comedy elements
A witless reprise of 's and 's biker movies written directed by and starring Larry Bishop
Does it count against you when you actually set out to make an awful movie It should
The script written by Bishop barely makes sense It lacks anything resembling wit unless you think it amusing that these aging cyclists brag about needing their three B's -- bikes beer and booty
Hell Ride is storytelling at its worst the thinnest possible excuse for a wall-to-wall string of beheadings throat-cuttings mass murders and orgies shot and edited in a murky lackluster faux-Spaghetti Western style
A repellent revenge fantasy about two elderly motorcycle gangs Hell Ride is indeed a hellish ride
Both dull and pretentious
Director Larry Bishop burdens his film with clumsy art-house ambitions that clash with its embrace of bikes beer and booty If any of this sounds amusing be warned it's not
The main problem is Bishop's adamancy on playing the lead tough guy when he's got the face of a shoe salesman
Hell Ride is so bad that if I were forced to choose between seeing it again or seeing my worst nightmare version of what Wild Hogs  might entail I am fairly certain that I would select the latter without a moment's hesitation
Bishop's film is an exercise in style and tone that certainly takes much from the genre that inspired it but it certainly contributes nothing to legitimize its artistic integrity or extend its historical longevity
Not to be confused with the more famous grindhouse biker flicks of a bygone era Hell Ride misses out on that critical sense of freedom on the open road
Maybe only once every six months am I in the mood for jokey sadism but this struck me as the right picture for the right time
It's a claustrophobic dud full of ludicrously purple tough-guy dialogue and lip-smacking vamps in bikinis how hot with so much monotonous hip violence there's scarcely room for anything else
The only thing that works in 'Hell Ride' is the throwback style and visual tone it lovingly mimics
Having a properly slimy bit of modern exploitation filmmaking isn't something to scoff at but I do wish that the experience had even a bit of fizz to it
A revenge and biker warfare bonanza that will appeal to the folks who loved masterpieces like The Warriors and Switchblade Sisters
Instead of a sublimely ridiculous and sleazy bike-movie homage Bishop delivers self-amused emptily crude faux-grindhouse that only fanatics of the genre will excuse
The dialog is clever nutty and syncopated with a soundtrack -- of the CC Rider vein -- which ain't half-bad either
Hell Ride is a smoldering yet completely dull wreck of a movie
Bikers babes blood booze  and blah
When they were counting down the  minutes I just kept saying to myself oh man this movie still has  minutes left Oh man this movie has  minutes left I just couldn't wait to get out of the theatre
The film is a disaster in every way possible I have rarely seen a big budget star studded major studio motion picture flop this hard
While  Minutes is no  To Yuma this beat-the-clock escape artist fare that's light on logic and heavy on the shoe leather sustains sufficient breathlessly nerve-jangling lockdown for the duration despite a couple of weirdly situated plot holes
I should have walked out after  minutes
The movie runs blandly through its paces without generating an ounce of tension or suspense
The kindest thing one can say is that director Jon Avnet and screenwriter Gary Scott Thompson bought a flatpack version of a thriller and then couldn't follow the instructions Manuals can be confusing
It verges on so-bad-it's-good territory but just isn't entertaining enough Lacking in tension and pace poorly edited and starring wholly unsympathetic characters this is just dull drab and boring
Now that this stupendously inept serial-killer flick has slithered into theaters the diminutive legend had better clear room in his closet for another cinematic skeleton
There are more thrilling ways to spend  minutes like counting from one to
Interestingly the more overblown and insincere a performance Pacino delivers in a film the more self-important and bouffant his hair gets Here it's so towering it takes up  per cent of the screen
It's called Eighty Eight minutes But in fact it's one hundred and seven minutes of your life that you lose should you persevere with this witless thriller
Full of dreadful turns and awful dialogue There's been a breach in my most secure area mutters Al at one point  Minutes is  too long
Good Sunday afternoon entertainment but it won't hang around the multiplex for long
Pacino looks half asleep throughout no doubt concentrating solely on his cheque while the script is a catalogue of clichs and contrivances
THE WORST FILM OF THE YEAR
Ridiculous and ultimately disappointing thriller that stays just about watchable thanks to an amusing pair of performances by Shouty Al and his hairpiece
The overwrought production sieve-like plot and ludicrous characters merge into something genuinely hilarious But that's clearly not what cast and crew were going for
Don't bother
Minutes is the sort of overblown thriller in which every action no matter how insignificant is pregnant with portent yet it's a film of nothing but red herrings
Lacking tension in its setting and empathy for its characters  Minutes is a woeful excuse of a thriller thanks to the inept direction by Jon Avnet who has forgotten to inject emotion and thrills in what can only be described as a bloated crime movie
Either flush with cash or in possession of incriminating photographs of a Freestyle Releasing executive somehow this family pushed their tween mystery into a theatrical release this weekend despite making a picture almost completely devoid of polish
Do-nothing Sarah may be the dullest most featureless and inactive protagonist in recent movies -- great news for those Scooby-Doo die-hards who never got enough Freddy
The filmmaking is borderline incompetent -- the acting varies from okay to awful the cinematography is unpleasantly soft and the tone is badly misjudged
The film is sunk by a pervasive stasis the byproduct not of mood but of the filmmakers' amateurish abilities If there's one thing Nick and Disney know it's that youthful entertainment needs to keep moving
The ear-numbing dialogue explains and explains rather than dramatizes though and the performances are earnest and flat
Beset by bad lighting limited visual imagination and acting so wooden it might have termites
Clumsy tween-focused thriller wastes potential
awkward in a high-school-drama-club way
Someone must have greenlit this one without realizing it doesn't have a ghost of a chance
Middle school-level dialogue and acting -- like a young-adult novel written by junior high kids rather than for them -- don't help
Landon won't be a household name any time soon
Clocking in at just over eighty minutes Sarah Landon is a filmmaker's clinic in consistency how to be consistently awful
Imagine what Catch- might have been like if it had been written by that creepy grade-school classmate of yours who was always talking about how cool it would be to stick a cherry bomb under that dead squirrel he found on the side of the road
Twice as violent and half as funny as anything resembling a good movie it's still a hell of a ride
What's wrong with Postal can be summed up pretty easily - it's a comedy that's never once funny
Indeed Postal is THAT kind of movie one that substitutes rancor for real wit that utilizes splatter when a few script rewrites would have worked much better
This reviewer is not easy to offend but is very easy to bore And I was bored out of my tree for most of Boll's lamely conceived clich-ridden debacle
Infantile irreverent and boorish to the max Postal explodes with bad attitude and lousy filmmaking
In short we have a trainwreck of a comedy that goes on far longer than you'd care to watch an actual trainwreck trying too hard to be offensive the entire time and delivering its jokes with the timing of a -year-old with a mixing spoon and a soup-pot
Postal is largely just a byproduct of Boll's self-promotion rendering the film itself in essence beside the point
It's hard to imagine a worse movie will come out this year and yet Boll's growing notoriety has already earned the trailer millions of hits on YouTube Ed Wood never had it so good
Postal strikes me as marginally superior to Morgan Spurlock's merely boneheaded Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden But that's like saying Moe is smarter than Curly
Fearlessness isn't inherently funny Postal's touches of wit are lost in the flying body parts gross-out gags and the full frontal spectacle of Foley's no-longer-private parts
Almost worth watching because it's so unbelievably abysmal that you can't believe any filmmaker let alone one as hated as Dr Boll would deliberately make light of such subjects in order to shock and offend
Is it funny Not really but it has isolated flashes of inspiration Elsewhere the film is a jumbled needlessly violent mess sloppily edited and feckless in its attempts at political satire
Boll's self-inflicted dose of Schadenfreude is the only sure shot in this miserable misfire of a satire which aims for campy but hits crappy instead
If this movie had been made by an unknown young director a lot of critics would still be panning the movie for its inconsistencies -- but many others would be praising his courage
I guess you could call it a satire but it doesn't particularly care to take the time or energy to spin the satire in any meaningful way it merely thunders over all its ideas like a rabid elephant
The second half of the movie is a mess with only light humor and some audacious bits to liven up the mood
Boll mistakes shock for satire and crudity for cleverness in this desperately unfunny hopelessly clueless catalogue of the ills of America that ends up rejoicing in what it believes it is sending up
The end result is a film that feels as though it's been conceived and executed by a third grader
Convinced that Arab terrorists are inherently hilarious and that shooting fish in the leaky barrel of American pop culture takes marksmanship Boll is a boor and a symptom of something sad and dehumanizing
Deal has to take the title of the worst film ever about the game and that includes the how-to videos with Joan Rivers impersonators you see in your Vegas hotel room
Directorco-writer Gil Cates Jr gives us a by-the-numbers execution of a by-the-numbers story which would barely be movie-of-the-week material but for Burt Reynolds's star power
a movie making a brief stop at local theaters on its way to DVD bargain bins and cable showings at two in the morning
About now is when a critic would throw in a reference to a low poker hand to compare it to but Deal can't even rise to a pair of twos
Thoroughly predictable in every way including an obvious ending that tries unsuccessfully to bluff the audience Deal feels fake and trite
Deal could use a touch of the slickness that's making the blackjack drama  such a greasy hit
A raft of pros appear as themselves but this story will likely seem less exciting than an actual competition
You've got to know when to walk away from a movie like this right away and that's only if you can't run
Success isn't in the cards for this plodding poker drama
Reynolds doesn't convey any of the lightning bolt insouciance that made him arguably the greatest movie star of the 's and 's really but rather just stands there
There are plenty of movies that prove entertaining despite their familiarity this isn't one of them
There is more complexity in a sub-par episode of the Teletubbies than in anything to be found in Deal
They've got to do something else with these poker movies
Highly derivative embarrassingly hollow
The outcome is never in question but for fans of the game even simulated action is preferable to perfunctory drama
There is so little originality here and so much faking it that it hardly justifies critical analysis
so gossamer thin that it's hard to feel strongly about it one way or the other
It's not the cards you play but the people    which is why poker movies in this case Texas Hold'em are far more interesting than many sports movies
As a piece of entertainment it's like being dealt a pair of twos You could certainly do worse but
An embarrassingly toothless and endlessly boring story about characters we barely get to know doing things that are more exciting than they make it seem
It's a PG- slasher picture This means the results are vaguely on par with having sex through a blanket
Tedious slasher flick is both gory and boring
There's no need to wear a corsage to Prom Night And leaving your higher brain functions at home might be a good idea too
This movie accomplishes the impossible It makes you disappointed not to be disappointed by a disappointing twist ending
While it's certainly not as atrocious as the likes of One Missed Call it's certainly one of the worst of  so far
It's tepid fare with a vacuous cast particularly when compared with the previous version featuring Jamie Lee Curtis as the scream queen
If early slasher films as their critics claimed punished teens for having sex the new 'Prom Night' punishes teens for their conspicuous consumption stretch limos hotel suites and so on
Every cheap-scare trick in the genre is deployed but so feebly that not one of them works
Bog-standard unimaginative and oddly bloodless
Corny monotonous and very far from scary
By far the worst 'slasher movie' remake to date replaying all the clichs but delivering none of the guilty pleasures
A caffeine-free horror that's just as dull disappointing and dispiriting as attending a real high school prom
Well-dressed sure with a few kicks for green teens but hardly a wild night
Annoyingly it's a rich premise that offers all sorts of possibilitiesyet McCormick doesn't appear to be bothered
PROM NIGHT is a must avoid and is the real reason why studios don't screen certain movies for critics
One of the most memorable nights in a teenager's young life is grist for a pretty unmemorable movie in this tame horror entry that follows conventions to the letter
This do-over isn't so much an improvement over the original as lousy in a whole new direction a nearly bloodless slasher film with fewer surprises than a broken jack-in-the-box
I liked the way in which the teens find ever-more elaborate pretexts to take themselves off alone into the darkness to investigate this or that
Though a remake in name only Prom Night nevertheless improves considerably upon its eponymous predecessor
Thankfully Prom Night's predictable ending doesn't suggest a remake of the original's  sequel Hello Mary Lou Prom Night  No kidding that's what it was called
All The Tribe accomplishes is reminding you that The Lost Boys is still a better film and can't be topped
It's ridiculous that Warner made this movie especially because it's obvious that it was made to cash in on the film's title This in no way shape or form is a LOST BOYS movie other than the fact that Corey Feldman and Corey Haim cameo
As if the world needed another reason to celebrate The Lost Boys The Tribe and every second of its bumbling uselessness just made me want to hug Joel Schumacher's film even tighter
Precisely the cheap-end cash-grab non-movie I expected it to be This is insultingly bad
derivative Sadly the movie we really wanted to see is only hinted at about thirty seconds into the credits
Fans of disembowelment and tits--and c'mon who isn't--have reason to check out this Uncut version
I've got a fever and the only prescription is more Corey
No one needs a telephoto lens to see what's coming in Shutter
What happens is the same as every other J-horror remake only less so at least in part because it stars Rachael Taylor and Joshua Jackson instead of actual famous people
Are more of these Asian remakes in the offering I Shutter to think
The latest in the downward spiral of remakes
SHUTTER should have been the scariest horror film since THE RING but instead it was infuriatingly bad This joins ONE MISSED CALL in the ranks of worst horror remakes of all-time and I highly recommend skipping this one for the original
It's all rather predictable and often irritatingly derivative
It's an effective scary story that depicts women with spirit - on both sides of the divide
Workmanlike at best derivative predictable and slightly dull at worst
Workmanlike at best derivative predictable and slightly dull at worst
Yeah this movie is a must avoid
As pretty and bland as its lead actors
paramenei eksisoy an ohi kai perissotero flyaro ap' tin pigi tis empneysis toy Apo tin opoia krata episis to megethos ton logikon almaton oksynontas ta opoy mporei gia na klepsei merikes eykoles fantezi tromares eno kseperna to prototypo sto epipono t
Shutter features another pale scraggly haired young woman a la The Ring haunting our protagonists Yawn
Shutter the latest photographic enlargement of an Asian horror picture is clearer and sharper than many of its predecessors but even the most expert re-touching cannot obscure the fact that we have seen it all before
Similar to a theme park ride that scares kids this Asian horror film frightens only newcomers to the genre from which it practically bootlegs
the film feels like a made-for-TV movie
Out of the list of horrible remakes I've experienced in  Shutter really isn't the worst one I've seen yet but it sure does suck enough to rank up there
an absolutely redundant piece of work
Avoid unless you've never seen a horror movie in your life or you just have very low standards
Shutter which attempts to do for cameras what The Ring did for videocassettes what Pulse did for computers and what The Grudge did for grudges
One of the worst movies I've ever seen
ena matso kakomoirides sernontai stin ammo kai ton ilio s' ena ftino proheiro afeles kai kakogoysto deigma karampinatis gerontikis anoias toy Emmerich
The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing this movie to enter a movie theatre It was like a bad made for TV special that you would see on ABC or NBC
In fact while sitting through this banal attempt at a big-scale epic I could not help but go through a checklist in my mind of all the movies  BC borrows from
It was a pleasant surprise
But the folks who made  BC have filled their film with a sub-Disney plot and inserted a few measly slivers of action that hardly warrant all the mystical hubbub and romantic angst
Ready to rumble scantily clad Neanderthals gone wild gliding around the globe faster than high speed Internet And while dodging seemingly nearsighted menacing reptiles with bad manners whose oversized choppers repeatedly miss their mark
most of the film is simply a matter of waiting for it to end
A disaster that can't even get the computer generated images right
I can't help but think that  BC started out as an idea that sounded like Wouldn't it be cool if we had wooly mammoths and saber toothed tigers and people all in the same movie and went from there
Would make a good drinking game silly fun but not good A critic sitting near me snorted in derision at my the costumes kicked ass but I won't back down They were really cool
People expecting a fun action movie will be severely disappointed If you get drunk with some buddies and go to make fun of it you might like it more But that doesn't make it a good movie
Brace yourself for a mammoth disappointment
BC takes film making back to the stone age
Heavy on moronic mysticism and light on imagination excitement and shot-to-shot coherence
Violent poorly conceived prehistoric action
Some backgrounds look as though Roland Emmerich and crew broke into a museum after hours and filmed in dioramas Rather than a disaster film this was just plain disaster - a departure from Emmerich's usually effective milieu and his most moronic movie
One of the biggest problems with the film is the casting
All Emmerich cares about is not being boring On that level he succeeds
A lousier adventure movie you won't find this year  BC belongs if not back in the stone age then at least back in the mid 's where this sort of mindless effects-driven drivel is best left
