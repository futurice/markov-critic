For all its flaws Our Vinyl Weighs a Ton a reference to Public Enemy's Miuzi Weighs a Ton is a rare tour of the other side of the tracks
It would be nicer to hear more about the business side of things but the passion shown by the participants is infectious
This is aimed at the faithful rather than casual music fans but the evangelical fervour shines through
Jeff Broadway's excellent new documentary Our Vinyl Weighs A Ton skillfully and artfully tells the Stone Throw story as it reaches some great heights and sinks to some deep lows
Our Vinyl Weighs A Ton the solid great-sounding new documentary on this essential fixture of independent hip-hop has an unmistakably melancholy air
it's difficult to ascertain what the film has to say about underground hip-hop or music in general beyond showcasing the compelling independent artists at Stones Throw
The viewer witnesses the pure joy of creating and the genuine love the men exhibit in collaboration
A rambling tour of Yuletide frivolity that comes from a very serious - and personal - place for the writer-director
As contrived and endearing as the Christmas songs it celebrates
The best-selling singles in America have been Christmas songs and Kezin's look at the b-side -- the business of Xmas -- is entertaining
The Christmas-morning thrill of discovery is appropriately evoked in this warm and spirited if scattershot documentary
A gonzo mix of interviews and music concocted by first-time feature film director Mitchell Kezin His passion for alternative holiday music is clear from start to finish
Movies like this are a labor of love Often they don't work but this one does This is a fascinating musical and cultural journey through a unique aspect of Christmas
It's a film better experienced than intellectualized one that unfolds like a dream And like a dream afterwards you'll probably ask yourself Did I really just see that
Let me just share that this is  of the more oddball romances you'll ever witness Imagine George Romero directing Harold and Maude As for the finale which includes a wolf a full erection and fireworks cascading from a torso it's a hoot and a half
A queer retelling of the werewolf myth The Samurai reveals the dark side of a character who comes out in the light of the full moon wearing women's clothing rather than an animal's skin
Neither of the actors is particularly strong and some scenes are clumsily handled but this only contributes to the gutterheart sensibility of a film that is considerably more enjoyable than it ought to be
A lucid haze of sex and violence compellingly offbeat and irrevocably Other
It's so evocative on an instinctive level that its panting excitement overwhelms the sense of questions unanswered and often unasked
Situates the phenomenon inside an identifiable world rather than setting it aside like it's some kind of otherness
Some of its subjects definitely register high on a creepy meter but the film does provide an interesting look at our expectations of manliness gender norms and comments on sexuality
The payoff is just lovely helping to revive A Brony Tale when it needs it the most returning focus to the primal release of a man who's terribly excited about group of cartoon ponies and their shared adventures
As Brent Hodge vividly illustrates in his entertaining insightful and affectionate documentary about a seemingly bizarre subculture there's more to this phenomenon than meets the eye Heck it might even make a Brony out of you
At the same time it's fascinating to watch Hodge peel back the curtain and show this community in all its perplexing glory
While it could have benefited from more insight from the people involved with show and follow-up commentary from Bryan the movie poses interesting questions about gender roles in modern society
This is an accessible briskly paced documentary about a phenomenon that warrants exactly the level of investigation Hodges has given it here
Cheery docu dispels stereotypes of male My Little Pony fans
Terrific documentaries are a dime a dozen ones this multifaceted are to be cherished
There's a lot to chew on in this family-centered documentary but the wonderful archival footage of Coney Island adds enough garnish to justify the time
A portrait of a classic rags-to-riches success and a tough boss who was fanatical about the quality of his fare and the speed of its delivery
A pleasant and in some ways remarkable surprise
Throughout Famous Nathan there are enough scenes of customers gleefully wolfing down juicy frankfurters to convert even the most staunchly vegetarian viewer
Filmmaker Lloyd Handwerker treats the project as genealogy rather than corporate image-making And with home movies and private interviews at his disposal no one is better equipped to tell this story
Famous Nathan is an attempt to preserve something of the past before it's lost forever
Since many of the themes from Illmatic have become mere clichs in contemporary rap this film serves as a reminder of the potential and the promise that hip-hop truly holds
The album lives as a touchstone and a turning point in New York hip hop The film may be far less significant but it does bear witness to the music's greatness
It's a celebration of the seminal album's th anniversary but also a dissection of the influences that allowed a street poet like Nas to create such an influential album
As both an origin story about a great artist and a distillation of 's urban blight it's as breathless and real as any street-corner rhyme
The movie is inspiring and tragic and directed by street artist One it's captured in an artful emotional way that will speak to an audience beyond rap fans
Time Is Illmatic does a terrific job of weaving hip-hop history into a highly personal story
A well-made and well-shot companion piece to the album telling the story of Nas' early life and the circumstances that led to his birth as a hip-hop legend
Here's  minutes well spent
A wide-reaching tale locks into focus one about hope through music told with style feeling and economic punch
Flirts with glamorising the rags-to-rap-to-riches story but in doing so stays true to its subject
A strikingly photographed and genuinely revealing exploration of the early influences that formed one of the most distinctive voices in rap
Where Time is Illmatic soars and surprises is in its historical approach to this portrait and in its portrayal of another side of the artist -- his brother Jungle
This isn't just a walk down a troubled memory lane with the focus of this laudatory but never fawning picture later switching to the making of the album that caught the public imagination
A stylish portrait of groundbreaking talent whether you care about hip-hop or not
An essential celebration of the New York rapper's groundbreaking  album
You certainly don't have to be a pre-established fan to appreciate this picture as sometimes just seeing how much something can mean to others is gratifying enough
Paints a vivid portrait of all that Nas the artist and Nasir Jones the person are in a remarkably efficient -minute run time
As humbling as hagiographies come
The result directed by graffiti artist and first-time director One is less an ordered history of facts than an emotional snapshot of the artist's childhood and thoughts about where he is today
Brief informative and direct the historical details post-Illmatic grow less interesting yet the film's first half is electric and engaging
A distressing story to be sure but one that belongs to a young girl whose unforgettable fortitude is undeniably encouraging
Butterfly Girl opts for a celebration of life over a fear of death to ultimately devastating effect
Despite the obvious sadness at its heart the doc benefits from an unforced optimism
Bell says she didn't want to make a disease movie but instead a human portrait of survival She succeeds
Abbie Evans is a dynamo
Bell's film captures the spectrum of emotions here Abbie's desire for more as well as her fear her parents' need to protect her as well as their wish to set her free
What the film directed by Elkabetz and her sibling Ronit does is cast a harsh light on a dark segment of Israeli society that is mostly obscured from the outside world
A frequently stunning examination of frustration and indignity
Ultimately the movie is wearying but then it's likely supposed to be If Viviane's going through the wringer you're going through the wringer too
It's tough and unsparing but the grimness is never gratuitous
GETT shows that sexism is not an aberration but baked in by design into some of our deepest institutions and fighting it is a long journey down a hard road
And you thought Sharia Law was the only thing liberal Western women had to fear
If the goal of Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz was to convey the sheer grueling ordeal faced by their protagonist they succeeded in a way that's both powerful and challenging to maintain dramatically
Ronit Elkabetz brilliantly captures Viviane's mounting frustration and the sense of release in those moments when she just doesn't care anymore
The movie could just be a two-hour lecture but star Elkabetz and her brother Shlomi who co-wrote and co-directed make it into an affecting and even suspenseful human drama
The movie appeals to an unreal world that would easily make the viewer believe it is a real chronicle of a real trial full review in Spanish
The Trial of Viviane Amsalem has a script full of sharp wordplay with just the perfect amount of expressive silent moments full review in Spanish
Shlomi Elkabetz and his sister develop a strong narrative free of melodrama full review in Spanish
This movie is a great discovery full review in Spanish
The movie is soberly directed by Shlomi Elkabetz and Ronit Elkabetz contemplating a brilliant complexity that sorts the passionate earnestness between two extremes and that explores a divorce trial in a profound sense full review in Spanish
The film is minimalist but moving A Separation meets Anatomy of a Murder a methodical and emotional process film fused with a potent legal drama as well as a fascinating look inside a religious bureaucracy where male supremacy is written into law
I never thought I would enjoy a film that takes place in such a small space for so long Well not since Hitchcock's Lifeboat anyway
Stand out roles include Menashe Noy who plays Amsalem's lawyer and Sasson Gabai who plays Elisha's lawyer and brother However it is Elkabetz's performance that carries the film
The movie's not entirely grim-there are colorful supporting characters and moments of comedy-but the experience is absolutely nerve-wracking Given the film's political nature that's as it should be-Gett is meant to agitate not gratify
A serious and sometimes humorous and even compassionate consideration of spousal responsibility
Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz who based this trilogy loosely on their own family history have managed to illuminate the humanity in the characters and turn what could be a preachy issue-oriented movie into a moving film
it's executed with such charm and skill in every gorgeous frame that I walked out completely and totally smitten
Beautifully understated and grumpy in that special -something kind of way
It's hard to explain just why I so adored Tu dors Nicole Can't you just take my word for it
Mostly I connected to its gentle melancholy the sense of a life changing in almost imperceptible ways
Lafleur counters the lackadaisical narrative with direction editing and sound cues that are playful but precise mysterious but potent making every note in this exceptionally well-made film something to savour
Tu Dors Nicole accurately recreates that feeling of youth when the summer seemed like it would last forever As the French say it's trs drle
The night scenes are particularly resonant mixing humour suspense and textured visuals This is the kind of film dream from which you feel reluctant to wake
Stphane Lafleur denies Nicole the angsty treatments given similar characters in films like The Graduate and Frances Ha by refusing to saturate the film with an undergirding sense of charm
Will appeal to lovers of Frances Ha
Nothing happens but everything thrums
Director Stphane Lafleur shoots in black and white with a sure and delicate eye
Martin is as desperate to grow up as Nicole is reluctant to take the next step Both are at a crossroads that this wonderful lighter-than-air movie depicts as a major turning point
Lafleur's film is a quiet trifle that sneaks up on you like a pleasant dream you might have and then gradually forget Its very slightness is its greatest weapon
Under the direction of Stphane Lafleur this Qubcois comedy takes on an air of wondrous restlessness in its minor ambitions
The football is dreadful but the colourful players - like transgender defender Jaiyah Saelua - make this hilarious documentary a big-hearted delight
There's possibly more terrible football on display than even Scottish audiences can stomach but like the team it's a documentary with heart
Charming and uplifting
A triumph-of-the-underdog documentary so amusing and inspirational you'll have to Google events to ensure it's not a mockumentary Back of the net
This is the beautiful game living up to its name
A genial documentary crowdpleaser about the world's worst international soccer team
I could not possibly care less about football and I fell hopelessly in love with this movie and with the can-do amateur team it introduces us to
Slightly muted closing stretch lets the air out of the ball ever so slightly but by then it's already in the top corner
As an antidote to Premier League cynicism it couldn't be bettered
The pace is a little leisurely and it doesn't demand to be seen on a big screen but much like the characters it portrays Next Goal Wins is an unassuming winner
Even if you have no interest in football you will be swept along by the emotional pull of this story willing the team on to experience the joy of scoring their first goal never mind winning a match
'Tis the season for over use of sporting cliches noting the romance of the World Cup But if you can't find it in Next Goal Wins you're not going to find it anywhere
Watching this was the first time I have ever punched the air because a football sailed into the back of a net And very probably the last
An inspiring never-say-die chronicle for all ages
A crowd pleaser in every sense of the word
One of the smallest triumphs in world sport inspires one of the year's most moving and entertaining documentaries
Both predictable and shamelessly heart-warming
Captivating moving sports docu some swearing
Next Goal Wins is a classic underdog story but it is entirely original
Even folk who don't give a hoot about football will find their hearts warmed by inspirational documentary Next Goal Wins
As well-intentioned feel-good humanitarian acts go The Only Real Game hits one out of the park for fanatics of America's favorite pastime or good-hearted folk with a little extra scratch in search of a new pet project
Bank's story of the women men and children so passionate about their game is itself wholly absorbing
The history lesson is fascinating and it's nice to see an American export other than a Hollywood blockbuster engendering good will
A stirring ode to cultural bridge-building
A clear-eyed snapshot of sports hope struggling against socioeconomic stagnation
A documentary about the love of baseball in a region of India that is a cauldron of resistance to colonialism What's not to like
The Only Real Game is refreshingly devoid of sentimentality yet despite itself oddly affirmative
Delivering humor heart and a toy-filled adventure Toy Story that Time Forgot is another wonderful entertaining and playful installment to the Toy Story franchise
The spirit remains true and this is a nice add-on to the movies with the familiar subtext that the cool effects in video games are no substitute for a kid's own imagination
Funny warm and not afraid to include gags clearly intended more for parents than their kids it's the kind of production that keeps the franchise fresh and crassly merchandise flying off shelves while waiting for yet another sequel
Delightful franchise add-on has happy messages some peril
It's still fun still sweet and still a pleasure to hear Tom Hanks Tim Allen Wallace Shawn and the gang voice these characters but I checked my watch several times and would have probably preferred it at something closer to Toy Story Toons length
An instant delight that is sure to be a favorite perennial for years to come
It basically contains the emotional capacity of a six-minute Toy Story short so don't expect a tear-filled transcended experience But do expect a playful amusing addition to the growing saga that both kids and grownups will enjoy
Writerdirector Steve Purcell brings these new toys to life with small details that ring true to life from the herky-jerky movement of a dinosaur playset's elevator to a brief TV commercial-length theme song for these battling dinos
It's a smart addition to a canon whose intelligence is already well established
Quite frankly it makes you realize that the Toy Story series could easily continue uninterrupted to infinity and beyond
Something rare and rewarding a Dumont film that paints its small-town milieu with as much humor as violence though there's a fair dose of that too and finds some tenderness in life's absurdities
Li'l Quinquin is a quasi-epic farce that mostly wears a poker face as it elaborates his continuing obsession with the collision of humankind's bestial and spiritual impulses
This is not funny stuff but then Dumont isn't after the sort of laughter that makes viewers feel better His idea of the human comedy remains as grim as it is absurd
Saying P'tit Quinquin is Dumont's funniest and warmest film doesn't count for much but could I interest you in one of the sharpest autocritiques in recent memory
We may find ourselves both frustrated and riveted Something tells me Bruno Dumont wouldn't want it any other way
The action seems to rise organically from the locale and Dumont's grand yet intimate fiction fuses his inner world with the historical moment
The film twists itself every time you get think you get a handle on it mixing violence and humanism frivolous jokes with profound considerations of behavior
Dumont packs in the literary and cinematic references in exchange for the usual suspense of the television mystery
Rich with casually relayed social observation and parody presenting its odd behaviour incompetent police-work and murderous hate-fuelled chaos without fanfare
Heavyweight French auteur Bruno Dumont demonstrates his gift for deadpan comedy
like Dennis the Menace as reimagined with the darkly humorous shadings of the Coen Brothers yetdistinctly Dumont
Dumont's supernaturally insoluble crimes are also influenced by Antonioni and Haneke and his outrageous comic turns have also taken something from the French deadpan comedy specialists Benot Delpine and Gustave Kervern
The injection of oddball humour does nothing to lessen the seriousness of the subject matter or the compassion with which Dumont regards his characters' hardscrabble lives
P'tit Quinquin immerses you in the bucolic life of a French village near Boulogne where a serial killer seems to be chopping up bodies
The baroque body count is just a red herring with France's insularity chauvinism and bad blood the real devil here It's a dark lesson in history which released in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre seems all too prescient
Dumont uses the extra sprawl of his canvas and the luridness of his premise to indulge himself in the best most playful sense
It may sound weird for a film about brutal murders but maestro Bruno Dumont gives us a charming and often funny story too
Li'l Quinquin exists to suggest and provoke rather than declare and is all the better for it
The acting is superb Sofa Espinosa really became Gloria in and out the stage Full review in Spanish
A movie that gives you an in depth look at the life of Gloria without ever designating victims or villains Full review in Spanish
Keller doesn't focus on Gloria's scandall and rather opts to show the real story of a woman caught up in the fame game Full review in Spanish
For all of those who are sceptic about this movie let me remind you its based on a serious study and it shows Full review in Spanish
Great journalistic work by Berman and an interesting directorial debut by Keller Full review in Spanish
A film with a mature script that never falls into the cliches of biopics or tries to be exploitative Full review in Spanish
Gloria is an important film because its based on real facts but it would've been better if it wasn't Full review in Spanish
His secret weapon is called Sofia Espinosa who injected vigor excitement and rhythm to a film which we thought it was a deception and it was a surprise Full review in Spanish
The climactic battle has some especially impressive close-up scenes of Batman in hand-to-hand combat that are among the best yet in these DC animated releases
Bolstered by a compelling story that features one of the most intriguing elements in Batman mythology the film ranks among the best in the series so far
More a mash-up of two of the most highly regarded Batman stories in the last  years than its title implies it stands alongside the best efforts of Warner Bros Animated
Excellent tale with disturbing imagery and frequent violence
A very good DCU animated offering with brisk action good pacing and compelling character drama
Striking the right good-natured tone between admiration and amusement I Am Thor isn't particularly slickly or imaginatively packaged but its straightforward DIY presentation feels apt
Jon Mikl Thor is a showman and a stalwart a flat-out legend and I AM THOR is the often uproarious and sometimes quite poignant love letter he deserves
A charming subject goes a long way in character-study doc I Am Thor an imperfect but energizing portrait of self-styled metal god Jon Mikl Thor
Highly entertainingThankfully Thor's charisma is undeniable and it's fun to watch him interact with fans and dominate the stage
I Am Thor is an amusing show business tale that is all the more endearing for the respect it shows towards the eccentric and indomitable figure at its center
a making-of for a film that never got made - or at least never as intended The anecdotes here are frank and fascinating and there are few raconteurs more mesmerising than Stanley
If you love Moreau as I do or are even simply fascinated by its chaos for totally ironic reasons this documentary is a must-watch
Richard Stanley's vision of Wells' hellish utopia never materialized but its legacy makes for an appropriately insane real-life narrative every bit as brilliantly mad and maddening as the fiction promised to be
A wildly entertaining effort and a must-see for anyone who walked out of The Island of Dr Moreau confused and maybe a little irritated
Gregory might have done a bit more to differentiate this more extensive investigation from those earlier pics' conventions But the richness of the tale told here makes this competently packaged feature a keeper nonetheless
It doesn't make for the strongest film but it does work like a case of people swapping outrageous war stories over a few beers
Whether you remember the actual movie or not Lost Soul is an excellent dissection of a multi-million-dollar movie gone off the rails
Some of the worst movies give way to the best documentaries
The film puts a brave much-adored face on a disease that has touched so many families
This simultaneously heartbreaking and joyful doc provides a fitting capstone to an extraordinary musical career
The film is as much a love story as it is a farewell
A wrenching document Glen Campbell I'll Be Me is a painful but necessary tribute to a singular talent
Ultimately I'll Be Me is both an unconventional tribute to this American icon and a deep-down cri de coeur for more research on viable ways to retard the progression of Alzheimer's and perhaps one day find a reliable cure
This is a portrait of a star gaining luster even as his mortality becomes more evident
heartbreaking surprisingly entertaining
Campbell's long goodbye to music and memory is astonishing part of a farewell tour forced by Alzheimer's and each second was dramatic swelling hearts with missed lyrics and cruelly perfect guitar licks one thing he hadn't forgotten how to do
Even if hits like 'Wichita Lineman' or 'Rhinestone Cowboy' are not among your jams it's impossible to not get swept up by the emotions on display
I'll Be Me takes you along on that tour and shares with you the ups and downs of this most personal of illnesses
The film includes vignettes of the more than  concerts in that goodbye tour all of which serve as vivid and painful images of the downward spiral that is Alzheimer's
One of Glen Campbell's final songs was Not Gonna Miss You dedicated to his wife I can't imagine anyone listening to it and not being moved
As a salute to a musical master I'll Be Me does Glen Campbell justice And as a rallying cry for the fight to end Alzheimer's it's potent
Director Keach places his cameras so that you feel like you are part of the film
A harrowing yet also inspiring portrait of the American pop music icon as he copes with the rapid deterioration of Alzheimer's
It's a rare intensely personal look at Alzheimer's that will be tragically familiar to those who have lived with it and sobering and sad for those who have not
Emotional and intimate
Life is the collection of memories and Campbell is losing them But there is solace in the reality that you will not miss what you cannot recall
Both moving and enlightening even if it does occasionally take on the tone of an educational video
The result is an oddly effective hybrid of music and medical doc
A definitive reflection on the work of two great directors and the specific slices of cinema they so fruitfully cultivated
Fitfully captivating though plenty amusing
Engaging look at Ricky Leacock from his friend Les Blank marks a valedictory for both filmmakers
Like Mr Leacock's other films it helps give the feeling of being there that he strove for
Provides a leisurely insightful history of documentaries that parallels the filmmaker's biography done in the style he championed by Les Blank who he greatly influenced
The great documentarian Les Blank died in  - two years after his mentor Richard Leacock - but both are warmly present in this set of interviews Blank did with his teacher in France  years ago
The ordinariness of this film-and the flatness of its video-shot images relative to Blank's beautiful-looking 's films-isn't a significant drawback given how eloquent Leacock can be
A tender counterpoint to Whiplash Anyone in any field of artistic endeavor could learn something about their struggles from watching Bernstein's patience and by listening to his arguments against the importance of fame
By the end of our introduction Bernstein emerges as a man who has found a way to build order out of life's chaos through music
Seymour An Introduction is just that - not too much biography or history And one needn't be a music aficionado or a musician to appreciate the modest erudition coming from this man
Whether or not Hawke got any answers to his questions about the purpose of being artist seeking them under the guidance of a teacher like Bernstein resulted in this work of art
Coming off of his superb one-two performances for Richard Linklater in Before Midnight and Boyhood Hawke continues to work at a creative high level He demonstrates a rapport and openness with his subject that proves exceptionally affecting
It's a nice movie full of musicians talking of their love of the art form - you'll be enthralled believe it or not listening to a couple of guys talking about B flat
Octogenarian pianist Seymour Bernstein is the charming inspirational subject of this appreciative occasionally fawning documentary directed by the actornovelistfilmmaker Ethan Hawke
Expertly directed by Ethan Hawke Seymour An Introduction is both a portrait of an artist's life and a quiet repudiation of the assumptions that might tempt some people to call Bernstein a failure
Remarkably elegant film from Ethan Hawke about his friend classical pianist and sometime-composer Seymour Bernstein is one of early delights of
Like a touching master class on living correctly listening to the charming Bernstein will have you changing keys
Hawke's cinematic etude may not unlock all the mysteries of music but Seymour An Introduction is universal enough to be understood by a bananafish
The great joy of the film whether you know piano or not is watching Bernstein teach
An idiosyncratic very personal portrait of an inspiring musical sensibility
a gentle yet insistent interrogation of a monkish master an -year-old piano teacher named Seymour Bernstein who in the grip of terrible stage fright compounded by existential dread gave up a promising concert career
It's a poetic statement but the reason the music and the man stick with us is because they inspire us to work harder at whatever we are doing regardless of whether it can be played on a piano
A lovely purposefully small movie that just dusts the edges of many deep concerns that Bernstein now in his mid-s is still wrestling with
Bernstein seems like a man who has found fulfillment in his life and his students seem fulfilled as well His story is compelling and his words seem to be loaded with wisdom He is a fascinating character
It's quiet considered and spellbinding with a great deal of beautiful music - some of it performed exquisitely by Bernstein himself
More crucial to the film than Bernstein's personality endearing as it is is the music he plays
There's no pressing story to tell or even especially vital achievement to record so the film probably counts as bit of self-indulgence from Hawke but it's got a very good heart
An empathetic snapshot of a country that is almost never depicted in such an accessible light
North Korean culture is lensed in part through a South Korean perspective with the final chapter asking Is reunification possible
The fact that Yoo isn't regarded as an outsider by the people she's recording allows her to capture a number of revealing unrehearsed moments that startle in their raw emotion
Scattering history lessons and ambiguous imagery amid Ms Yoo's engagement with North Koreans her film implicitly asks What must they think of us
Yoo's film is a necessary correction of how we should view or think about what life is really like in North Korea even if the work feels somewhat limited by its own necessity
Weirdly this tonal combination actually works most of the time at least
It's a grade above most high school comedies that trade on sexualized teens a laugh-out-loud sweetly-irreverent-but-never-raunchy look at education from the inside out
With a strong ensemble cast It uses the documentary style in an effective manner that kept the character beats consistent with the laughs and felt like a true winner
This excellent mockumentary highlights the business of teaching high-school kids to hilarious and poignant effect
Teacher of the Year is a smart and funny movie that manages to pull off one of the more difficult balancing acts in filmmaking it actually is smart while still being funny
Thanks to a highly-skilled group of comedic actors with years of experience --- largely honed on television --- and the absurdist humor of writerdirector Jason Strouse Teacher of the Year is a film I can heartily recommend
Strouse's strong suit is his casting His writing and directing are solid but his ability to select the right actor makes all the difference in Teacher of the Year
The answers the movie provides aren't as satisfying as its mysteries but it's a creepy little surprise
Aided by cinematographer Grant Greenberg's visual mastery Gaby Hoffman has you on the edge of your seat as her paranoia grows in leaps and bounds especially as you watch her run through the streets scamper down staircases and Skype
Writer-director Stewart Thorndike works wonders on a micro-budget production shot only in five days This debut intimates the promise of even greater things to come from Thorndike
Competently played all round and with some effective stylistic elements this is a film that could do with a bit more ambition of its own but that still handles itself well enough and very impressively indeed for something shot in mere days
With a gripping performance by Gaby Hoffmann the first feature by its writer-director is a winningly unsettling genre exercise whose style and polish belie the constraints of its microbudgeted five-day shoot
Erika Frankel's documentary is finally revealed to be a story of prolonged adjustment to retirement and a poignant illustration of sublimated redemption
Frankel has a fine eye for telling detail and the result while sentimental is as irresistible as the dessert cart
King Georges feels stretched into feature length but its ending neatly portrays a man with a fierce personal code who seems to have accepted change
A poignant funny and well-seasoned portrait of autumnal fervor
The relationship between the young American and the old Frenchman is as rich as one of Perrier's sauces the pupil and the teacher the son and the father the keen protg and the stubborn classicist
King Georges reminds us that a singular dining experience can often be the expression of a very singular personality singular temperament singular discipline
The vividly detailed behind-the-scenes glimpse of one of America's best kitchens along with a holistic view of the title character make King Georges a flavorful treat worth savoring
Fun fare for foodies especially those with a taste for classic French cuisine and nostalgia for the posh French restaurants that once dominated the culinary scene
By patiently letting events play out past the easy and expected end-note Frankel has fashioned a fine story out of what might have been merely a cautionary tale
Insightful but strictly for avid fans of classical chamber music
Richly rewarding if maybe too brief portrait of a great violinist
Mr Miller lets Mr Mann and his violin do most of the talking drawing on assorted interviews and vintage performance clips that convey both the skill and the enthusiasm underpinning his subject's long career
Watching Mann teach is a delight for the same reason it is to watch him perform It's because here you sense we are in the company of genius
A documentary that sings the praises of a founder of the Julliard Quartet a violin virtuoso teacher and composer
Pray's film though not as weighty or groundbreaking - no pun intended - as its subject nevertheless does a good job of presenting both art and artist
As a chronicle of a city falling in love with a rock Levitated Mass shines As a documentary on the nature of art however it misses a few big opportunities to reach for something truly fascinating and profound
Levitated Mass is more entertaining than a glowing artist profile has any right to be because Pray remembers where his subject came from
Levitated Mass is document critique and celebration all in one
As soon as anyone starts say something thoughtful about Heizer or the social value of art Pray jumps to another neat-looking wide shot of the rock to keep us oohing and aahing
Sneakily compelling
Half a century after The Beatles here's a Spanish film that reminds us just what that music represented to their first generation of fans - freedom and a connection with others touched by the same songs the world over
Smart and delightful
The film never gets too heavy But light as it is it does a good job of capturing a time and place that few of us are familiar with
An evocative portrait of a time and a place and also a subtly rewarding character study of three ordinary people in search of that extraordinary dream a taste of freedom
The actors help to bring this engaging tale to life
Their adventures are the subject of a delightful feel-good movie that skilfully combines humour sentiment and tart political commentary
Ultimately good-hearted and gracefully handled enough to transcend the leisurely slightness of its material
The central performances overcome the conventional material to offer relatable characters on a universal quest with the always excellent Camara a perfect guide through pleasant territory
It's a project that could easily be weighed down with nostalgia or over-determination but there's a generosity and humour about the performances and the direction that keep the film light and buoyant
While the stakes of the film may not be particularly high you can't help but feel invested in the journey
Javier Camara best known here for his work with Pedro Almodovar is quite good as the teacher delivering a performance of real tenderness and depth In Spanish with subtitles
Living Is Easy With Eyes Closed is subtle in the truest sense in that it says and suggests much and does so definitely but through a minimum of means
Cmara's performance is excellent suggesting a deep melancholy that's only hinted at in the script
If you're looking for a spooky little film that's free of pretension and sometimes logic and are into getting some quick shivers you really cannot go wrong with The Taking of Deborah Logan
The Taking of Deborah Logan or as it was originally called 'How Found Footage Nearly Wrecked a Solid Horror Romp'
An unexpectedly solid little horror flick that gets a lot more interesting the longer you give it
it's truly amazing how the film manages to stay fresh and original amidst the sea of what has come before
Not at all original or distinctive in this volatile genre's ever-changing standards but it is cautious well-made and so driven by believable performances that it earns more respect than one might have assumed it deserves
Wittily cleverly and thoroughly covers that residency thus providing those of us who weren't in that city at that time the chance to experience just what a major and wondrous artistic event it was
This cinema release will be useful for people who don't have cable and are interested in questions about the ownership of contemporary street art
The film itself is playful and quite fun
The talking heads can't tell us much but Moukarbel makes deft use of crowd-sourced footage to convey the wildly different ways New Yorkers engaged with the works
Very enjoyable documentary following the fun-filled month the secretive street art collective known as Banksy spent spreading its works across New York citya fun ride
How much you like the movie will largely depend on how much you like the art For the record we like it quite a bit
Reveals a provocative social experiment and raises questions about ownership of public art
It's downright playful in fact funky chic and cheeky Somewhere Banksy is smiling
A documentary with all the noise mayhem pandemonium and ingenuity of both the artist and the city that never sleeps although it still manages to dream
Moukarbel's straightforward film is more domesticated than the work it profiles but it's a dutiful document of an event that despite Banksy's fame remained on the periphery of the art world establishment
Made for the smallscreen but don't hold that against it this is an enjoyable romp through Staten Island the Lower East Side inner Manhattan and beyond and is essential for any Banksy devotee
Perfectly suited to film noir fans who like their stories dark their characters dark and their heroes decent but morally tested
Relentlessly depressing and cynical and although it was well-made its cruelty made it an uncomfortable experience
In many ways Fritz Lang's The Big Heat scripted by former crime reporter Sydney Boehm laid the groundwork not only for Dirty Harry but for the whole sub-genre of 'rogue cop' films that began to surface during the Vietnam era
May be Lang's greatest American film
Mr Lang can direct a film He has put his mind to it in this instance and he has brought forth a hot one with a sting
One of Fritz Lang's very best films
Strong noir thriller from the great Lang in his later years
In-your-face tough cop-gangster noir yarn features gritty Glenn Ford and great Gloria Grahame
Overwhelming crime thriller with plenty to say and brilliant storytelling
That's the beauty of Lang's moral ambidexterity He tells the story of a heroic cop while using it to mask another story so much darker beneath
Lang strips down William P McGivern's novel to essentials giving the story a narrative drive as efficient and powerful as a handgun
Lang at his cruelest
One of Lang's most accomplished and influential noir crimers with a top-notch turn from Glenn Ford as the avenging cop-angel a role that Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry and Charles Bronson Death Wish would develop in their s revenge thrillers
Brutal atmospheric and exciting -- highly recommended
Lang presents one of the great works of film noir The acting is first rate Boehm's script tough and efficient and the whole affair is photographed with the appropriate expressionist chiaroscuro lighting
A scalding face-full of harsh reality courtesy Fritz Lang
Ford's portrayal of the homicide sergeant is honest and packs much wallop Lang's direction builds taut suspense throwing unexpected and believable thrills at the audience
Everything about The Big Heat is hard boiled
Fritz Lang once the master of grand expressionist scenes directs with a stripped down style and a lean narrative drive
For those who take their film blackMoral rot gets full play in Lang's  police drama Blu-ray
Rene Clement's subversive direction makes us root for Delon to pull off a tricky tightrope disguise as suspicious police pursue him from hotel to apartment and town to town
Although Purple Noon is a singularly thrill-less thriller it is lovely to look at
An oddball example of the genre
Tom isn't your average Hitchcock hero he has the advantage of being a sociopath
A fascinating earlier version of 'The Talented Mr Ripley' that features a much different murderous protagonist
Alain Delon in his third film gives a staggering chilly performance as the psychopathic killer
'Talented Mr Ripley' with a French accent stylish and memorable
A gem of a psychological thriller with Alain Delon and Marie Laforet in top form Rene Clement's French version of Patricia Highsmith's noir novel is far superior to Minghella's  remake
The sinister occurs within the confines of the beautiful like a disease eating away a beautiful tree from the inside
Having just discovered its existence I was interested to see this  French adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel which Anthony Minghella also adapted in  as The Talented Mr Ripley
Clment's strategy is to film Ripley's actions with little editorializing and the film is both laid-back and taut at the same time especially in the second half of the film as the stakes get higher and it becomes more of a thriller
Plein Soleil remains a masterpiece It defined the career of its director who became known as the French Hitchcock
Condemned now to exist in the shadow of a talented impersonator this earlier adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's remarkable novel has been all too readily overlooked despite possessing considerable charms of its own
It's Delon -- impossibly beautiful impossible to read cold cool -- who steals the film
Tempering Hitchcockian intent with the experimentalism of the French New Wave the result is as seductive as it is suspenseful a bracing study of amorality
Highsmith had some doubts about the ending which feels less daring than the one in her book but there's a clever irony to it Hitchcock would have appreciated
Delon is a terrifically good in the role his almost unearthly perfection is creepy itself as if he is imitating a human being
Alain Delon excels as gentleman psychopath Tom Ripley in Ren Clment's beautifully restored classic
This expertly made film is utterly mesmerising And its exploration of ruthless ambition is still fiercely timely
Its mechanical aesthetic suggests that rather than having to sublimate what remorse Tom Ripley might feel toward his actions he simply doesn't experience any
The French master has taken a large number of dramatic elements and made them fresh and funny
One of the great tributes to the art of moviemaking Truffaut has never made a film as warm or generous
It's fun in all the little things it reveals about moviemaking as well as in the characters we meet
unjaded and hopelessly smitten with the filmmaking process
A treat for movie lovers
Truffaut's love affair with motion pictures is evident in every scene
Day for Night exudes all the enchantment zaniness and transitory pleasures of the movie-making business
Truffaut is looking at the world from inside a glorious obsession everyone outside looks a little gray and dim
Truffaut clearly communicates his consummate love for film in ways certain to bring knowing smiles to all movie lovers
Um filme feito por e para amantes do Cinema
It might not be a great film or one of Truffaut's arty ones but it's entertaining observant and witty
Lovely
Cinephiles will lap it up
It's a hilarious and informative movie and in the pantheon of films about filmmaking it strikes a neat balance between the operatic neuroses of ' ' and the warm pastel-hued nostalgia of 'Singin' in the Rain'
An exhilarating Oscar-winning celebration of the movie-making process
It is a breezy richly enjoyable if not especially profound film about cinema it conjures the ambient dizzy sexiness of movie artifice and it's also notable for a remarkable cameo by Graham Greene
One of the great love letters to the chaos and creativity joy and sorrow of movie-making
It is a Pirandellian affair an elegiac celebration of a dying kind of cinema a meditation on the connection between film and life by Truffaut
Though not one of Truffaut's strongest works this loving tribute to the chaotic process of filmmaking is charming which may explain its win of the best foreign language film Oscar
Franois Truffaut's love letter to filmmaking
Seeing the film ten years later - and in the mighty shadow of Pixar's recent masterpieces - the film feels a little chaotic safe tired on its feet
The film is a series of gorgeously conceived set pieces and terrific character interaction and unlike newer films it's not afraid to get a bit grim
Toy Story  is the first mature Pixar film and a high watermark that if Pixar's surpassed it in the last fifteen years at least it hasn't often
Toy Story  has an extremely tough act to follow
'You can't rush art' Pixar's bliss in art and play is part and parcel of both the creation and the meaning of Toy Story  a celebration of the pure joy of doing Blu-ray
explores the same themes but running in place has never seemed as witty touching and visually engaging as it does here
As good as Toy Story looks Toy Story  looks even better
This isn't a made-for-video that they decided to put into theaters but a version intended from the first to be theatrical That's important because it means more detail and complexity went into the animation
The toys are back with even more hilarious vengeance The story's twice as inventive as its predecessor And the vocal talents of Tom Hanks Tim Allen and others bring even fuller soul to the proceedings than before
Against most odds the sequel turned out to be at least as wonderful as Pixar's  original -- maybe more so
Faster funnier and wilder with more cunningly contrived computer effects
It's playtime for viewers of all ages
It's a tough act to follow but director John Lasseter and his Pixar crew have done about as well as can be expected with Toy Story
Pixar the animation studio that teamed with Disney for both movies has broken technological ground since the first Toy Story and TS shows off its newest expertise with one smart visual joke after another
They've done it again The folks who brought you 'Toy Story now present Toy Story  another clever riotous tale of life in the toy lane
Filmgoers will need to remind themselves that the characters were created by a computer -- not exactly a medium we associate with this kind of love tenderness and care
Pixar's  Toy Story and its superlative  sequel ushered in the supremacy of computer-generated animation
Toy Story  is a brilliant example of that rarest of Hollywood phenomena a sequel to a major hit film thats as good if not better than the original
Toy  is colorful and funny and the computer-animation from Pixar Animation Studios creates a convincingly detailed environment for the toys
No parent who's been roped into leading the troops to a matinee need fear being bored gags are Simpsons-like conceived to tickle several generations at once
Felix and Oscar are now part of the American mythos
Comedy at its best
Two grown men sharing an apartment    and not so much as a mention of the word 'homosexual' This could only be
It does well as an evening's entertainment
An irresistible double act from Lemmon and Matthau
It's just one hilarious situation after another in this classic comedy about two polar opposites one compulsively neat the other a slob forced to live together
The film still remains fresh as amazingly the many one-liners and the wacky situation still work
Truly classic comedy in Neil Simon school with superb Lemmon and Matthau
For all its overfamiliarity this is a good play easily Simon's best and Matthau and Lemmon inhabit it with grace and style
The only successful adaptation of a Neil Simon play
Lemmon and Mathau's finest hour
he plot nothing more than a premise based on Simon's real-life brother Danny goes nowhere but then it's not really supposed to
it's still the original movie that best captures the essence of the characters and story
When critics discuss chemistry that onscreen magic that occurs between perfectly paired actors the electricity exemplified by Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is a textbook illustration of same
Acting is all Lemmon and Matthau are terrific in their first teaming in this highly amusing comedy which is sharply written by Neil Simon but poorly directed by theater helmer Gene Saks
a durable classic the sort of comedy that doesn't try to yank laughs by cramming its fist down our throats
The key to the movie is its stars it is Matthau's reserved yet committed man's man that gives the film its comedic edge
The Neil Simon comedy that lit up Broadway for more than two years shines again in this flawed but still funny screen adaptation
Classic buddy comedy finds hilarity in its mature themes
Simon's The Odd Couple is proof that smart writing and adult themes can still make for a fun evening at your family home theater if your children are older than
a relatively laid-back almost poetic vision of the Old West its characters and characterizations outshining its well-worn plot
The reason My Darling Clementine never seems to stray or lose focus is Henry Fonda
There is no clearer distillation of Ford's visual style thematic concerns manner of storytelling and development of character than My Darling Clementine
One of the great American films a romance about the tug between savagery and civilization that continues to define this country
The best Western John Ford ever made without John Wayne on board
I haven't seen a better docudrama about Wyatt Earp but on the other hand the venerated lawman has yet to be the subject of a masterpiece
Gorgeous
Wonderful moving John Ford true classic western
May be John Ford's most achingly beautiful Western
That the title mentions neither Earp nor the OK Corral is an indication of the lightness with which Clementine carries the legendary baggage of its subject matter
Vintage John Ford
The first couple of times we saw My Darling Clementine on the late show we watched the beginning fell asleep in the middle woke up at the end and thought we had sat through one of the best films we had ever seen Then we finally forced ourselves to sta
The quintessential Wyatt Earp movie and one of the greatest westerns ever filmed
John Ford's last film as a contract director for Fox is a perfect western
Launched the series of masterpieces in the late 's and s that forever after defined Ford as the greatest director of Westerns in history
The film subtly complicates viewer expectations early on eschewing clear-cut character rivalries in favor of more complex emotional and social configurations
If ever there was a gateway drug to the happy addiction of Hollywood oaters this is it
Ford the mythmaker was at the height of his powers in 's My Darling Clementine but it's a remarkably relaxed and assured piece of work
generally considered the Wyatt Earp film against which all others are judged
Simple in its storytelling while transcendent as a poem of rhythms bonds and values
If you haven't seen it for a while you may have forgotten just how fantastic the snappy dialogue visual gags and genuinely heartfelt story is
If anything it feels even fresher funnier and more thrilling in today's landscape of over-studied demographically correct moviemaking
There's no denying D adds extra texture to Pixar's seminal  buddy movie emphasising Buzz and Woody's toy's-eye- view of the world
The fresh look serves the story and is never allowed to overwhelm it leaving a beautifully judged yarn to unwind and enchant a new intake of young cinemagoers
As such Toy Story in D is never overwhelming Nor is it tedious as many recent D vehicles have come too close for comfort to
It doesn't enhance the experience because the film's timeless appeal is down to great characters and wonderful storytelling a classic that doesn't need goggles or gimmicks
The -D viewing doesn't make much differencebut it is a joy to see these superb films back on the big screen even after dozens of DVD viewings
Its lightness of touch has not diminished nor has its near-miraculous kidult-fusion humour
Turns out the real magic is nothing to do with technology it's in the words the voices the story But then a child could have told you that
So ingenious in concept design and execution that you could watch it on a postage stamp-sized screen and still be engulfed by its charm
I think I speak for all adults and kids when I say I can't wait for playtime
Time has been kind to it and future years I imagine will still be kind a classic is forever
Perhaps the film is meant as a pre-emptive sop to any resistance to a new medium
Though some of the animation seems dated compared to later Pixar efforts and not nearly as detailed what's here is done impeccably well
it is easy to see how virtually everything that is good in animation right now has some small seed in Toy Story
Introduced not one but two indelible characters to the pop culture pantheon cowboy rag-doll Woody Tom Hanks and plastic space ranger Buzz Lightyear Tim Allen Blu-ray
When Woody perks up in the opening scene it's not only the toy cowboy who comes alive - we're watching the rebirth of an art form
Apesar de representar um imenso avano tecnolgico a fora do filme reside no carisma de seus personagens e no charme de sua histria
Pixar classic is one of the best kids' movies of all time
To an entire generation of filmgoers it just might represent the most significant leap in storytelling that they will ever see
Classic Disney at his most lavish
Practically perfect in every way
Compared to even 'sophisticated' juvenile fodder the sheer exuberance of Disney's adaptation of PL Travers' children's classic should tickle the most jaded fancy
The first Disney movie ever to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar the musical received  nods setting a record for musicals My Fair Lady earned  nominations
One of Disney's greats
Julie Andrews' first appearance on the screen is a signal triumph and she performs as easily as she sings displaying a fresh type of beauty nicely adaptable to the color cameras
One of the greatest children's films ever
The grace of the effects makes it some kind of classic
The film was deservedly a mega-hit
Arguably it already seemed dated by the early s within a decade of its  release Yet still somehow the substantial charms of Mary Poppins live on
With all the subtlety of Battleship Potemkin a queue full of sour-faced old school nannies is shown blowing away into thin air to make way for the embodiment of modern female assertiveness
The sets are luxuriant the songs lilting the scenario witty but impeccably sentimental and the supporting cast only a pinfeather short of perfection
One of the best films ever produced by Disney indeed one of the best American films of the s a fantasy of the most delicate touch and charming disposition
World's coolest nanny celebrates family and fun
The entire set was constructed indoors and it shows the outdoor scenes are bathed in a dull gray light
Whether the movie's message is Travers-approved or not the emphasis on joy and empathy proves heartening even today
One of the great movie musicals and of that rare breed of deathless family entertainment that's guaranteed to transfix children well beyond this its fiftieth anniversary Blu-ray
Van Dyke exaggerated Cockney accent and all and Andrews have great chemistry together but it's really her interaction with the children and the magic of the story and the visual effects that charm audiences
Van Dyke's energy is prodigious especially when he leaps around with a gang of sooty chimney-sweeps on the London rooftops and the songs are classics
Van Dyke and Andrews have great chemistry together but it's really her interaction with the children and the magic of the story and the visual effects that charm audiences
It is an improbable masterpiece a film where everything just has that indistinguishable quality of fitting together
A rare musical whose story -- scripted by Betty Comden and Adolph Green -- is just as good as the songs
Watching Singin' in the Rain is an exuberant magical experience -- a journey deep into the heart of feel-good territory
Compounded generously of music dance color spectacle and a riotous abundance of Gene Kelly Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor on the screen all elements in this rainbow program are carefuly contrived and guaranteed toput you in a buttercup mood
Hollywood's best musical
False picture of early talkie era is not nearly as good as its reputation
A big beautiful film You can watch it  times and still giggle
The greatest musical ever A movie everyone should see over and over again If it doesn't touch you check your pulse
Mandatory viewing for even the casual moviegoer
Come rain or shine the Hollywood musical never got any better than this rip-roaring Stanley DonenGene Kelly classic
If you've never seen it and don't you're bonkers
At the time this film was treated as just another MGM musical but over the years it has gained in stature and is now considered as one of the best American films ever made--Read why
A fancy package of musical entertainment with wide appeal and bright grossing prospects
One of the shining glories of the American musical
this one's the Taj Mahal Armstrong's footprint on the moon the  Arizona-New York World Series the Clash's London Calling and the perfect foamy head on an expertly poured Guinness
For humour and sheer energy no musical betters Singin' In The Rain
Often considered the finest musical of all time
It's tough to fight the consensus that this is the greatest movie musical of all time although to be honest I would place it second just a hair below Top Hat but what's often lost in the praise is that this also qualifies as a great comedy
Kelly's delight - not in his own movements but in the sheer joy of being able to move - is contagious
Singin' in the Rain is another mighty fine MGM Technicolor musical comedy produced by Arthur Freed whose An American in Paris copped seven Academy awards last week
It combines stylish direction an intelligent script first-rate performances and overpowering atmosphere into one of the most tense and absorbing thrillers ever to reach the screen
To each his own Filmmakers as diverse as Quentin Tarantino and Paul Schrader were influenced by Melville and Hong Kong action director John Woo calls the film 'the closest to a perfect movie that I have ever seen'
Melville is much more interested in procedures than action The film is so stripped down that we learn as much as we need to know about Jef in the film's first  minutes
Alain Delon who was attacked by some narrow-minded reviewers in his day for being stiff is perfectly cast here displaying a cool calm demeanor at first then an equally calm desperation as the chase gets more intense
Fedoras and trench coats Film noir in cool blues and greens Frenchman Jean-Pierre Melville's  film Le Samourai is the real deal
One of the pleasures of Le Samourai is to realize how complicated the plot has grown in its flat deadpan way
Le samourai expresses a kind of loneliness to be sure but it's that of a teenage male dreaming about Hollywood movies and their accoutrements -- penthouse apartments acerbic cops melancholy city streets smoky card games fancy jazz nightclubs
One of the better examples of genre cinema
Even if its influence on contemporary filmmakers weren't so striking and acknowledged Le Samourai would stand well enough on its own merits strongly suggesting that some of the greatest films of the future may well come from the past
Melville's style remains haunting and elegantly spare just right for the kind of hit man who lives in silence in bare and colorless surroundings with a lonely caged bird
The film has been a tremendous influence to the crime drama genre
Le Samoura's narrative players are designed for easy interpretation This fosters the plot's complication as well as Melville's inimitably stylistic filmmaking
Making films this good wasn't a principle for Melville it was a habit
By far the coolest
Achieves an atmosphere of mesmerizing otherworldly beauty and grace
Melville's film had a major influence in Hollywood
A major work from a highly influential director -- Walter Hill and John Woo have both taken a lesson or two -- yet one whose films have been until now inexplicably neglected in the US
Delon's inscrutable presence adds to an unnerving atmosphere of anticipation You feel that something bad could come crashing into the frame at any second And you would be right
an enjoyably stylish entry in the French crime film tradition but a decidedly minor one
Cold masterly without pathos and not even particularly sympathetic it has the noble structure of accuracy
What a great movie
Never to be surpassed never to be repeated
Restored Hitchcock thriller charms chills and sparkles
In the hands of a lesser talent this might have become a self-conscious stunt but in Hitchcock's it has the tightly wound perfection of a flawless sonnet or sonata
Don't resist the urge -- steal a peek at it now and be reminded why Hitchcock is still without equal in the clammy thrills department
hitchcock perfection
Alfred Hitchcock's answer to why he makes films and perhaps his darkest one both as a romance and as a thriller
The deliciousness of watching the film as it's intended to be seen is that the big screen gives Rear Window back its claustrophobia
An early ad summed up one of the film's enduring appeals If you don't experience delicious terror then pinch yourself--you're most probably dead
Of all Hitchcock's films this is the one which most reveals the man
Hitchcock classic
Essential and unmissable
the film surely remains one of the most memorable and downright essential examples of the slow-burn thriller genre
Just possibly the second most entertaining picture after The  Steps ever made by Alfred Hitchcock
a taut and verbally jaunty thriller
As close to 'perfect' as a film is likely to get
In this brilliant movie about watching the neighbors Alfred Hitchcock turns the lens on his audience We have become a race of Peeping Toms notes one character not only commenting on Jeff's obsessive voyeurism but also that of the cinematic spectator
Hitchcock masterpiece stars peeping Jimmy Stewart
It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's inspired audience-participation films watching it you feel titillated horrified and ultimately purged
Beneath pointed dialogue perceptive character development and tense plot twists the movie plays like a breakpoint in our journey towards complete voyeurism
There can hardly be anything left to say about Citizen Kane now revived on the big screen other than to comment on sublime moments
There's no denying that his bravura performance both in front of the camera and behind it is spellbindingly effective
With its spirit of visual and narrative innovation and Welles's precocious towering central performance Citizen Kane almost lives up to its own reputation as the best of all time
Many of the novel techniques Welles developed with cinematographer Gregg Toland were calculated to offer new angles on film space
To revisit it now is still to marvel at its wit audacity and sheer entertainment value
Citizen Kane is not only an entertaining film but it is also a deeply heartfelt though provoking and intelligent one as well Like a fine wine it has aged well over the last  odd years
Classic should be required for any movie lover
Citizen Kane has been cited as the greatest film ever made from so many different quarters it's a wonder that a Congressional law hasn't been passed making it required viewing for anyone who claims they like movies
Orson Welles' epic film his stunning feature debut from  is an enduring masterpiece that was underestimated at the time of its release due to political reasons
Citizen Kane may very well be the most talked-about movie in history
Above all Welles was a showman and Citizen Kane is a three ring circus of cinematic ingenuity
One of the best films out there and certainly a high point in early cinema The love for Citizen Kane is deserved
Welles's deeply haunting depiction of the life of William Randolph Hearst has long been synonymous with the director's spectacularly odd and genuinely tragic career
An ecstasy of light and shadow of clashing textures and graphic forms such as hadn't been seen since the silent era
Perhaps when the uproar has died down it will be discovered that the film is not quite so good as it is considered now but nevertheless Hollywood will for a long time be in debt to Mr Welles
It can be classified as in a number of aspects one of the most arresting pictures ever produced
Remarkably creative film is inventive both in story and visual style
Some day and the time won't be long in arriving Welles will be the greatest director in Hollywood
The labyrinth is a central locus in the language of cinema Welles presents himself as its Minotaur giddy and somber
Citizen Kane written produced directed and played by Orson Welles is probably the most exciting film that has come out of Hollywood for twenty-five years I am not at all sure that it isn't the most exciting film that ever came out of anywhere
Quite the entertainer It's a little scary but not too frightening for children
A truly magical film from Nicolas Roeg that finally gets undermined by muppetry
As in his best films here Mr Roeg is a master of capturing the slightly off kilter sense of an apparently normal world His camera is unobtrusive and then suddenly it tilts a bit to jolt
A skewed dark adaptation of Roald Dahl's story featuring one of Anjelica Huston's most energetic performances
Strange and scary enough to fascinate parents and offspring alike
The wizardry of Jim Henson's Creature Shop and a superbly over-the-top performance by Angelica Huston gives The Witches a good deal of charm and enjoyment
Some kids will love it some may find disturbing
A minor but very enjoyable Nicolas Roeg fairy tale
A wildly entertaining fairy tale
Deliciously cruel to children Roeg remains true to Dahl's underlying sense of real horror
There are moments of genuine charm and solid invention but its a film that doesn't believe enough in itself
The Witches has an engrossing story populated with many amusing characters
The Witches is a slow-to-get-going but ultimately entertaining yarn about a nasty coven conspiring to turn Britain's entire populace of single-digiters into mice
The scenes of magic and mayhem are peppered with sly surprises and Anjelica Huston plays the wildest wicked witch since Dorothy got back from Oz
What a lot of fun is The Witches A few days before Labor Day it is safe to say that its the most enjoyable movie of the summer
Roald Dahl's book about a little boy on a seaside holiday who discovers a witches' convention plotting to annihilate children is brilliantly brought to life in this fantasy adventure by director Nicolas Roeg
Based on a Roald Dahl book Nicholas Roeg's The Witches is a film surprisingly faithful to the creepiness of the original
Real darkness seethes beneath the Once upon a time surface mostly due to Henson's seemingly curious selection of the brilliant and audacious Roeg to direct
Filled with grotesque witches and mouse stunts this is a wild fantasy for both children and adults Harry Potter was never like this
It's not a film for small children But for precocious first-graders with a warped sense of humor and an appetite for chills thrills and spills nothing could be better
In these cynical days when swashbucklers cannot be presented without an ironic subtext this great  film exists in an eternal summer of bravery and romance
it's a -year-old classic that still holds its rank as a movie among movies
The archetypal Hollywood swashbuckler everything big-screen derring-do should be rousing lighthearted witty romantic colorful moralistic and richly satisfying Flynn is the quintessential Robin Hood jaunty dashing and fearless
Superb Flynn adventure in every way
A flawless swashbuckler
One of the few great adventure movies that you can pretend you are treating the kids to when you are really treating yourself
Flynn catapults across the screen with the greatest of ease exuding so much charm and confidence that he seems to klieg-light the film all by himself
Movies like this are beyond criticism
Peerless action-adventure romp from the Golden Age of Hollywood
Errol Flynn buckles his swashes in this classic historical adventure
It is cinematic pageantry at its best a highly imaginative telling of folklore in all the hues of Technicolor
Michael Curtiz's adventure one of the most enjoyable swashbuckling epics made flaunting star Errol Flynn at his very best deservedly won several Oscar Awards including editing for Dawson and music score for Korngold
the quintessential movie swashbuckler
A rousing high-spirited family entertainment rightly regarded as one for the ages Blu-ray
If prankish Fairbanks was a man's Robin Hood handsome romantic Flynn performs for everybody else
A rousing and fun popcorn movie of the highest order
One of the best swashbucklers ever
Errol Flynn stars in swashbuckling family delight
Nearly every aspect of the Robin Hood myth we know today is embodied in this exciting socially aware adventure
The film is completely unabashed and utterly committed to delivering on its promise of adventure
A great nail-biter right up through the end
You've got to hand it to Alfred Hitchcock when he sows the fearful seeds of mistrust in one of his motion pictures he can raise more goose pimples to the square inch of a customer's flesh than any other director of thrillers in Hollywood
One of Hitchcock's creepiest and his personal favorite among his own films
A tense thriller with one of Hitchcock's most creepy villains
Maybe the most German of Hitchcock's Hollywood films
Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt is one of his grimmest and most impressive movies
First-class psychological thriller
First rate Hitchcock thriller with deceptive Cotten innocent but sharp Wright
Hitch's personal favorite and certainly one of his best
Like Lynch's fever-dream of transcendental perversity Blue Velvet Shadow of a Doubt is about awakening the simultaneous darkening and enlarging of the world
One of Hitchcock's finest films of the 's
The collaboration between Thornton Wilder and Hitchcock proves to be extremely fertile for it allows both American writer and British director to dissect small-town life way beyond the former's Our Town
The suspense builds effortlessly throughout
Hitchcock deftly etches his small-town characters and homey surroundings
Alfred Hitchcock's first indisputable masterpiece
A superb film
Peels back the welcoming warmth and sincere innocence of small-town life to reveal the gullibility and the navet underneath it's a fiction about the perpetuation of fictions
If the motives of filmmakers are revealed in the frames of their more obscure pictures then 'Shadow of a Doubt' is a resounding testament to the power of Alfred Hitchcock's vast creative engine
This thriller's horrible fascination lies in watching the strong-willed young lady's admiration of fondness for and idealization of a supposed gentleman clot and curdle The plot's marred only by a slightly rushed and convenient ending
Derives its power from its stark simplicity
Once over the mood of the film hits home and a longing develops to visit once again the characters of this warm and deceptively slight comedy
Life-affirming and often laugh-out-loud funny this is feel-good movie-making par excellence
It has always been easier to make films about misery than about happiness for happiness is so un-cinematic so devoid of conflict But Local Hero is a rare and welcome exception
For me the best film of the s
Slighty overrated because of its quirkiness
A whimsical delightful tale of a stranger in a strange land It is director Bill Forsythe's best ever
Charming little comedy
Charming cross-cultural tale about some outsiders from a Texas oil company whose visit to a small Scottish town changes everything
Absolutely wonderful
It demonstrates Mr Forsyth's uncanny ability for making an audience sense that something magical is going on even if that something isn't easily explained
Charming whimsical and practically perfect
A heartwarming and whimsical comedy of manners
Here is a small film to treasure a loving funny understated portrait of a small Scottish town and its encounter with a giant oil company
It's the feel-good flick of the decade
Forsyth cannot quite tease out of his characters the kind of strange sublety that Powell and Pressburger delivered but it is enough that he and producer David Puttnam succeed in making you realise just how badly this kind of film has been missed
It's loaded with wry offbeat humor and is the sort of satisfying personal picture that is becoming an increasingly rare commodity these days
Bill Forsyth directs the film with wry understatement and has gentle affection for all of his characters
Without question the most charming British film of the s
The thematics are rather cloying but the mood -- profoundly relaxed bemused -- eventually conquers
A poignant funny tale of a simpler life
Flaws aside  Idiots is an entertaining comedy-drama that's worth seeing for a thoroughly charming central performance by Aamir Khan
A superstar for more than two decades Aamir Khan has never been more popular than he is today in his mid-s
There's an unavoidable joie de vivre symbolized by Rancho's meditative mantra All is well and a performance charm that make this one of the more naturally gregarious Bollywood imports
Idiots takes a while to lay out its game plan but pays off emotionally in its second half
Despite its flaws  Idiots conveys a powerful message about how valuable your friends can be when they push you toward reaching your own highest potential
A fabulous achievement across the board A typical Bollywood confection but also social commentary on a dysfunctional engineering school system that pressures huge numbers of students into suicide
Very much a character-driven piece which not only makes the laughs bigger but also earns a deeper involvement
This quirky well-acted film proves as the title track says that generally 'all is well' with commercial Hindi cinema
Aside from the emotional whiplash  Idiots will be meaningful for anyone who has ever struggled to find their bliss
Passing Strange conjures a rare kind of theatrical magic with its emotionally raw frequently euphoric portrait of the artist as a young man
If you didn't have a chance to see it on stage Spike Lee's movie really is the next best thing to being there
Like Lee the artist formerly known as Mark Stewart possesses a powerful and singular voice one he uses to express vividly his own unique experience of growing up as a black man in America
A worthy public record of a show most people nationwide didn't get the chance to see
I can't single out a performance This is a superb ensemble conveying that joy actors feel when hey know they're good in good material
a cross between a PBS-style special and a concert movie
Film version of a fresh and spunky Broadway musical about a young black man's quest for self-understanding and creative expression
There's much to admire like the energy and Swiss-watch timing of the players though this remains a photographed play and not a movie
Tender sexy  funny moving and profound Passing Strange bears comparison not just to the great works of the American musical theatre but to literary landmarks like James Baldwin's Another Country and especially Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man
Passing Strange adds to Spike Lee's visionary resume and his eye for fresh talent
Moving thrilling and new
If you passed up the opportunity to catch this Tony-award winning rock musical during its Broadway run don't make the same mistake with Spike Lee's vibrant film adaptation
The invigorating result zestily edited by Lee's own inside iron man Barry Brown is in every way a knockout
Spike Lee's Passing Strange The Movie is basically canned musical theater but this is one Tony-winning Broadway show that's well worth preserving and seeing
You'll probably have to resist the urge to stand up and cheer with the onscreen audience during the emotional curtain call
A rousing emotional roller coaster that's a must see not just for fans of rock musicals but those with an eye and an ear for something unusual - compellingly so
Although more of a stage play than a film this performance has great acting and great music combined with a heart felt message
Lee doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to filming live theater but he moves the camera artfully and edits with an energy that matches the music And he makes good use of close-ups capturing the sweaty faces of a troupe of remarkable performers
Interesting that one of the best movies of the year is a filming of a play That's a sad commentary on Hollywood but sufficient reason to see this uplifting and very witty movie
It's a joyous production the music is alive and dynamic the skits are clever and funny and self-effacing and the show crackles with energy
Melville's film is stimulating and perplexing
Requisite viewing for any student of post-war French cinema
Jean-Pierre Melville's great too little-remembered debut and a classic example of circumstance leading to aesthetic advance
The Occupation and its effects on people's emotional lives are recurrent themes in Melville's work which has inspired the likes of Bresson Astruc Resnais and Rohmer
Filmed in the most daring way imaginable using a new cinematic language of transient expressions and glances the film was a root influence on Bresson and the whole French New Wave
if the niece's silence gives intimate expression to a whole nation's resistance Werner too far from being demonised as a villain himself becomes a dramatic embodiment of the tensions within occupied France
Although the movie's narrative and acting style are typical of older films Le Silence de la Mer has a modern sensibility and feel embracing subtlety and ambiguity in a way that was idiosyncratic at the time
Melville called it an anti-cinematic film and he creates the expressiveness in what remains unspoken the glances and gestures that take on grand drama in the minimalist presentation
One of the most hopeful and heart-rending movies I've seen this year
This documentary about the Afghani version of American Idol is good and worth a look but I was never swept up by it emotionally
An informative documentary revealing how decades of war and years of Taliban repression have fallen to the wayside however briefly as Kabul's answer to American Idol seduces a violence-weary Afghanistan
Like The Kite Runner novel and movie the documentary Afghan Star succeeds at dramatizing the lives of Afghans but those we see on screen are real flesh-and-blood characters -- people who let their true feelings emerge
Marking has a good eye for capturing the contradictions of Afghanistan
Of all the films to come out of the conflict Afghan Star is the most provocative because its message that people are essentially the same is a dubious double-edge sword
by the end of the  minute journey you'll learn more about contemporary Afghanistan than you will from a month of watching television news in the United States
The film's essential fascination and integrity swamp any qualms about its pacing or all-around moviemaking
The filmmaking itself is pretty much by the numbersBut there's some genuine tension as the competition field narrows
It's an upbeat film though hardly a convincing one that shows there's more to the popular TV show than entertainment
Afghanistan's version of American Idol shines a spotlight on a culture in transition Fascinating -- especially when it comes to the experiences of the woman who's risking her reputation and social standing in order to sing
One of the more surreal docs to come down the pike in some time
An inspiring fun documentary
Afghan Star is an engaging and important film and what it lacks in depth it makes up for in cultural impact Worth seeing
The film is both optimistic and depressing This film is about a real war with real deaths that is going on in Afghanistan and one of the battlefields of that war is a pop music contest on television
For once the McDonald's-like spreading of American culture abroad seems to have actually been a good thing
more than a popular phenomenon this documentary shows how a simple completely apolitical piece of entertainment crosses ethnic regional and cultural borders
For all the dramatic pull of the competition and insight into current culture and politics in Afghanistan it's a bit of a shame that the film itself is such a dry affair
Timely and intriguing docu was the winner of the Directing and Audience Awards at the Sundance Film Fest
While its style and structure conform to the well-worn template established by docs like Spellbound its success lies in creating an accessible fun way into serious issues
Has all the ambition of a Terry Gilliam or Jean-Pierre Jeunet epic
Absolutely one of the best films of
A movie that needs to be seen and it's a film that deserves to be celebrated
As action-packed as his film is Winans is in no hurry to tell his tale His pace is deliberate
There's a rapacious DIY showmanship at work here reminiscent of the calling-card chutzpah Robert Rodriguez and Peter Jackson showed in scrappier pre-blockbuster days
Winans is at his best in the visual realm and the early sections of his film in which supernatural entities are seen wordlessly working their nightshifts prove highly effective examples of narrative economy
A deeply personal look at the challenges of the simple life
By turns heartwarming and heartbreaking this is a well made and strikingly intimate portrait of rural farming life
The third documentary in Raymond Depardon's Peasant Profiles series is impassive but impressive
A remarkable achievement for a modest documentary that captures the daily experiences of farmers eking out a living in the low mountain valleys of Lozre Ardche and Haute-Loire
Raymond Depardon's documentary catches a poignant sense of lives and livelihoods inexorably dwindling
Progress has always been cruel modernity murderous But that brute reality doesn't mean we cannot pause with Depardon to mourn and commemorate
The beautifully shot Modern Life is a richly compassionate tribute to its hardy subjects and their slowly vanishing way of life
These are private people whose every careworn expression tells a story It's during their silences that we see the real human cost of progress
There is a richness of fellow-feeling and lack of condescension in Raymond Depardon's study of rural farmers in the remote French countryside
The pastoral beauty of the scenery and the lyrical journey of Depardon's camera are underscored by a sense of acute melancholy and hopelessness in this affecting film
A low-key but genuinely insightful journey through a vanishing way of life
Depardon's palpable sense of respect for his subjects lends the film a geniality that would otherwise have been hard to fabricate
Visually evocative and deeply moving on the theme of the deterioration of an ancient way of rural life
Though visually seductive especially for anyone longing to escape the urban jungle Modern Life is also to be admired for refusing to slide into postcard lyricism
It's an austere rewarding film
The interviews aren't that insightful but they have a simple poignancy
This could be the most sublime film you'll ever see about French cattle farming
An exception to the rule that film critics can't do better than the directors they criticize
When film critic Godfrey Cheshire decided to make a movie of his own he found the ideal subject right in his backyard
Tells a fascinating and complicated story of regional identity
There is a satisfyingly Faulknerian air of bizarreness about the episode and the shots of the grand old house being trundled down country roads are amazing
An admirable examination of one family's belated attempt to come to grips with if not atone for its role in America's original sin
Godfrey Cheshire's Moving Midway from his own screenplay provides a profound meditation on the paradoxes of race in America through a discovery of his own Southern family's hitherto hidden secrets
The whole idea of foundation -- as it applies to family history and an actual stately American house -- receives a thoughtful inspection in Moving Midway the graceful nonfiction film from Godfrey Cheshire
The film offers a probing and patient analyses of converging social movements related to everything from the nomination of the country's first black President to how people relate their family's history
Southern myths rise up then drop like flies in the enthralling documentary Moving Midway and all because director Godfrey Cheshire's cousin is moving house Literally
Moving Midway tells three stories each one worthy of a film of its own
Moving Midway isn't a simple-minded brotherhood-of-man tract The film is spiked with artfully edited excerpts from some of the movies that have shaped American racial attitudes over the years
What begins as a leave-taking turns into a homecoming that reflects the mixed-race society of the modern south
Quirky yet thoughtful
In its  minutes film critic Godfrey Cheshire's documentary Moving Midway records an amazing architectural feat and that's the least of its virtues
Cheshire deftly interweaves different interpretations of the antebellum South through architecture family memories black and white history and popular culture
The myth of the Southern plantation incorporates and carries on visions of destiny and history industry and identity
The details behind the actual move are the least interesting part of the film far more compelling is the history of slavery as presented through a polished Hollywood veneer
The move is something to behold
It is more successful as a study of Dixie social sciences than as a family video diary
Godfrey Cheshire a highly acclaimed film critic uses his cinematic smarts and sensibility to good effect in Moving Midway his documentary about the relocation of his ancestral home an antebellum NC plantation named Midway
A wild furious and genuinely unsettling ego is on display in Maurice Pialat's second proper feature
Pialat compared the structure of We Won't Grow to that of Ravel's Bolro for the gradually increasing fortissimo of its subtly varied-yet-repetitious phrases variations that here show as a gradual shift in the balance of power
The notion that love means never having to say you're sorry sits there bleeding a stake right through its broken heart
A painful view of the failures of love
The apricots blues and sand of summer gradually incorporate the yellows rusts and greens of autumn as the relationship slowly dies
The film's emotional and physical violence is startling enough bluntly realized through Pialat's visual plainspokenness but his refusal to situate the viewer in time and place has an unsettling effect that's harder to identify
It's intelligent measured work from the helmer who adapts his own novel for the screen easing entrance into a particularly toxic pairing
Superbly acted sharply observed and impressively directed Romanian drama though it drags a little in the early stages
The film remains dour truthful grimly droll
It may not scale the heights of the best recent Romanian films  Months  Weeks   Days The Death Of Mr Lazarescu but Boogie is still a bittersweet character study
This is superior film-making equally comfortable with the light Boogie's obvious delight in his nipper and the realistic family dynamic to the dark his risibly macho deceipt with a jolly hooker
This is a tough shrewd intelligent movie
An impressive chamber piece by a director who needs watching
Small but sharp and extremely well observed
Naturalistic performances long takes unfussy edits and a story that unfolds over a few hours are all present and correct
Hampered by pacing that borders on glacial the performances infuse the story with lingering melancholy
Three -somethings relive their gloriously lurid college days for one night only in Radu Muntean's Boogie a restrained and honest look at the male midlife crisis in an embryonic state
Impactful at getting at little known historical gems throughout
The most extraordinarily contemporary thing about Marker's intricate matrix in a William Gibson rather than a Wachowskis sense of the concept is how beautifully it lines up with and enlarges the contexts of recent films
Level Five pictorializes the cruel moment when curiosity encounters tragedy and the all-too-human abandonment of interest that can follow
By using Laura as an avatar Marker actually helps us see the visuals and their knotty meanings much more clearly
This film demands every cell of your cerebellum but its compelling surreality is hard to shake off
Tension is explored between the medium and the message - namely how history becomes selectively fashioned for the medium through which it is depicted rather than the other way around
A richly digressive provocative meditation on the cross-currents of technology engagement with history and wounded national identity
Level Five effortlessly anticipated the aesthetic and thematic shifts of st-century cinema even as it addressed the history and legacy of the th
Level Five a passionate and cerebral science-fiction adventure  belongs equally to the past the present and the future
Like every other film Marker made it's an exemplary and resonant address on the life of the mind and the life outside of that one
Already a cult film nearly  years old Level Five makes its US theatrical debut and the wait has turned the viewing experience into something even more meditative than director Chris Marker might have intended
The theories in Level Five simultaneously thrive in realms of computer science ethnography and cognitive psychology while the picture remains cloaked by the emotional weight of a historical tragedy that marked an entire nation
A poetic if occasionally opaque film essay on the  Battle of Okinawa
Level Five plays like a lost CD-ROM rediscovered in some thrift-store bargain bin
An ode to selective memory and oblivion
Suffice to say that Alien Raiders has a few modest surprises up its sleeve and that's more than most low-budget genre concoctions even attempt
Just like the classic From Dusk Till Dawn if not for the ridiculous title you wouldn't have any idea this was a genre film for the first third of the movie The acting is top notch and notable This is a TV geek's dream what with favorites from three st
It's The Thing set in a supermarket
Coming across like Quentin Tarantino Meets Aliens in a Supermarket this nifty little movie is enough to restore your faith in the vitality of low-budget independent cinema
While perhaps not the most original or groundbreaking sci-fihorror picture ever made Alien Raiders at least succeeds in executing a simple-but-effective formula
What could have been a fairly rote monster movie gives us a level of suspense that you normally don't get for a film that comes in under the radar
An excellent Warner Brothers actioner from
A patriotic Runyonesque spy spoof
Enjoyable WWII propaganda made by great cast and slick direction
Boisterous Warner Bros action comedy about Nazis in Manhattan
Strong acting from a superb cast make it more than watchable though both propaganda and direction are less than inspired
In spite of its slap-bang construction and its hour-and-three-quarters length the picture does move with precision and steadily maintained suspense
Bogart is great in this comedy thriller which was made during WWII and was much ahead of its time in narrative and tone
Bogart as retired mobster turned bigtime gambler is easy to take
Often-underrated director Vincent Sherman demonstrates a fine feel for the ambiance of s New York with plenty of machine-gun dialogue to spice up the proceedings
Bogart is on decent enough form and the usual suspects including Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre lurk in the shadows as they often did in these vehicles
They Aleandro and Argentina take what could be clichd characters and turn them into living breathing people that viewers can care about
The economic and social crisis that rocked Buenos Aires is only obliquely referred to but in the character of Beba -- so beautifully played by the great Norma Aleandro -- we see the image of Argentina a dignified beauty laid low by economic catastrophe
An unexpectly affectionate study of friendship between two very different Argentinian women who come from two different social classes
Dora and Beba both seem like real people independent women who struggle to hide how dependent they really are
Writer-director Gaggero shoots for a kind of docu-realism with a few overtly cinematic interludes like one well-paced split-screen sequence
Gaggero keeps his focus on the two women who in order to survive discover they must drop the facade of class and act upon their -year relationship
Live-in Maid is a fascinating directorial exercise in observing characters whose long history together is coming to an end
Even if I knew how things turned out in Live-In Maid a fine Argentinean film with English subtitles I wouldn't give away the ending
Live-In Maid is a modest chamber piece enriched by its affecting human harmonies and overtones
Gaggero not only draws out such nuances from the two women but illustrates the complexities of their friendship with carefully constructed cinematography
It's a small movie but a smartly detailed one
Writerdirector Jorge Gagggero has made a sensitive and lovely portrayal of two women
A vivid portrait of a society in the midst of wrenching change but it transcends its immediate context to become a thoughtful even unforgettable chamber piece performed with exquisite subtlety by two fine actresses
If you care about the art of movie acting run to the Charles to see Norma Aleandro bring tragicomic stature to the role of a haute bourgeois Buenos Aires woman fallen on hard times in Live-In Maid
As a character study it carries a quiet almost serene dramatic power as well as a strong current of dark humor
From the rooms and spaces which house the two women to the slow unraveling of their history together Live In Maid is a wonder of economic storytelling
It paints a lovely intimate portrait of a complex relationship and shows a side of Latin American life we rarely see on American screens
A simply told but emotionally robust movie
Live-in Maid is a study of two women who appear not to like each other very much yet their link makes for a moving drama about friendship
Incisive study of class relationships between a pauperized would-be aristocratic woman and the maid who is increasingly ready to break free
The directors prefer to secure O'Day's due as in the words of critic Will Friedwald the only white jazz singer who belongs in the company of Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday
The superb jazz documentary Anita O'Day The Life of a Jazz Singer is blessed with lengthy sit-down interviews with the singer herself
As a tribute to its star it's damn near essential
A high point shows O'Day in a black-and-white hat and form-fitting dress singing Sweet Georgia Brown at the Newport Jazz Festival That scene alone confirms O'Day's place among the greats
Although adding nothing to the previous body of knowledge on the iconic jazz singer this film is a precious collection of extremely unique jazz vocal footage that should not be missed
The portrait of Anita O'Day that emerges in this documentary is of a woman who always lived by her own rules
Alive with improvisational energy and rejecting the conventional biographical format the film pursues ideas and feelings rather than chronology as it scats through an archival wealth of interviews with O'Day and some of her most inspired performances
A gentle swinging film that pieces together her extraordinary life story from vintage performance clips and various interviews done over the years
Anita O'Day The Life of a Jazz Singer chooses from all the existing materials and is invaluable
Robbie Cavalina and Ian McCrudden's loving tribute to the great singer orchestrates archival footage late-in-life interviews and some spectacular music into one of the better bio-pics of recent years
O'Day is so exciting here the film doesn't just cater to fans but can generate new ones to celebrate the role of the song stylist for the Great American Songbook
The story of O'Day's talent and innovation is well told
A close-up look at the strange alchemy that is jazz singing -- singing at its most sublime
The incomparable songbird is finally given her due in one of the greatest music documentaries I've ever seen
Even if you're not nuts about the music in Anita O'Day The Life of a Jazz Singer I bet you'll fall for the musician
O'Day survived the rigors of what euphemistically might be called 'the jazz life' Comments Bryant Gumble 'Your personal experiences include rape abortion jail heroin addiction' Responds the unflappable O'Day 'It's the way it went down Bryant'
If Anita O'Day had to choose a motto for her life it would probably be That's how it went down
It's lovingly made with jazzy movement and though it's no great technical achievement its low-budget aura hardly detracts from the mission
Blue eyed soul at its very best
Even with that uninspired title Anita O'Day The Life of a Jazz Singer is a fitting tribute a fascinating and swinging documentary
A bitter comedy that has something meaningful to say about the creative nature of the artist
There are some nervous insertions of redundant comic relief but not enough to shatter the prevailing mood brilliant sunlight illuminating all the unmomentous ins and outs of a human passion
A lovely erotic and idyllic comedy
Powell's deft exploration of the emotional effects of their encounter prove much more successful than the film's odd comic subplots
Though it lacks the vivid touch from his earlier days it has a surprisingly comfortable relaxed feel still vigorous but also at peace
Age of Consent is never as provocative or engrossing as it should be but there is enough of interest especially Mirren to make it worth a look
The picture has immense charm and the actual photography particularly underwater scenes and superb scenery make it a good travelog ad for the Great Barrier Reef area where most of it was filmed
Late director Marion Cajori's documentary takes good advantage of intimate access to the iconic artist in an effort to chronicle the fascinating methodology behind his work
Through a series of vignettes interviews with Close's friends and family the filmmaker reveals the soul of the portraitist
Chuck Close about the painter photographer and printmaker by the documentary filmmaker Marion Cajori truly excels in its depiction of the physical process of making art
The result is a portrait that should interest art-savvy viewers and neophytes alike
Although the painting montages become somewhat burdensome in their repetition and an epilogue feels academic in every sense when Cajori finally pulls away from the finished portrait the sense of a job done to brimming satisfaction is acutely twofold
Director Marion Cajori's inventive endlessly fascinating two-hour take draws freely from those prior studies and from footage featuring Close and his contemporaries
In this exhilarating palm-moistening documentary by British filmmaker James Marsh Wisconsin Death Trip the twin towers are back to celebrate one of their finest moments
It's a great deal of fun playing not unlike a crafty caper film with loads of spine-tingling suspense
Present-day interviews and modern re-enactments provide the piece with its structure but it's the awe-inspiring archival footage that makes this a giddy watch
Man on Wire is absolutely breathtaking a documentary as life-affirming as it is artistically intoxicating
Petit transforms his stories into mini-masterpieces of performance
I would have found it easier to get emotionally invested in Le Coup rather than abstractly awed if I had a better sense of his coup de foudre
A feat like the one Philippe Petit pulled off deserves to be documented
The details of how the event was planned and staged are fascinating but a crucial element missing from the film is good cinematography of the actual event
Not only a fun heist movie but also a moving tale of spiritual uplift and beauty
Man On Wire's cinematic tension that in the wire Philippe Petit balanced on as he walked between the Twin Towers in the history-making high wire stunt shown in this compelling documentary The film's also a poignant memorial to the hallowed Twin To
Interviewed today Petit is a whale of a storyteller and he recalls with relish the chilling details of that amazing day
It all makes for an absorbing mischievously amusing yarn whose climax unfolds with unexpected emotional force
click to read full review
The tension builds incrementally reaching almost unbearable heights at its dizzying climax
Despite a known outcome James Marsh's documentary offers sublime thrills - grafting the tense suspense of a heist film onto an existential dissection of artistic accomplishment and true friendship
The pains of the public eye are acknowledged just as much as the joy this artistic endeavour brought people
The triumph of Man on Wire is its archival footage including the stunning scenes of Petit dancing and tumbling  feet above the pavement They put the most dizzying shots of The Dark Knight to shame
cheekily irreverent
captures the mysterious beauty of Petit's obsession without ever being so gauche as to 'explain' it
Exhilarating docu about high-wire feat has some edgy scenes
A lovely honest film about the hopes and dreams of young women
It's a caloric helping of melodrama but it's rendered effective by the exceptional performances and observant direction by the vastly talented Sandra Goldbacher
While watching 'Ballet Shoes' I felt like a time machine had transported me to London in the s then set me in the midst of this wonderful humanistic story
A pleasant if uninspired adaptation of Noel Streatfeild's children's classic
There are plenty of pleasures in this involving and uplifting tale which the young protagonists aspire to be actors aviators and ballerinas
Sisters learn value of love work and sacrifice
Ozu doesn't sentimentalize or condemn he merely observes human nature with calm and clarity
Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story might be his masterpiece
The way Ozu builds up emotional empathy for a sense of disappointment in its various characters is where his mastery lies
Ozu only has to train his camera on a face to uncover a sense of resignation or longing or loneliness and the mood if you allow it becomes quite overwhelming
Yasujiro Ozu was a master film-maker who specialised in middle-class family melodramas known in Japanese as shomin-geki and this moving story is one of his finest achievements
A quiet devastating poignancy that gently envelops you en route to an absolute tear-streamer of an ending
A difficult film to describe without making it seem less than the masterpiece it is 'Tokyo Story' is a remarkable work that gives a real insight into family life
This  classic is one of the cinema's most profound and moving studies of married love ageing and the relations between parents and children It is flawless and rewards numerous viewings
Ostensibly a snapshot of postwar Japan in the midst of profound cultural change it is the movie's painful depiction of familial disintegration that remains universal today
Newcomers to Ozu must be prepared for a rigidly controlled work with no mobile-camera shots This style elegantly frames the delicate performances which in turn do justice to the wisdom and compassion of Ozu's view of life
Ozu may have made subtler films but the clarity of his social critique here is wrenching and unassailable
This remains one of the most approachable and moving of all cinema's masterpieces
These characters never surprise us with anything showy lurid or sensational They're ordinary human beings treated with fierce attention that feels like deep respect
Ozu has made a film as simple in form and complex in nature as life itself Here every viewer is cast as a tourist and yet will feel right at home
Ozu's long shots knee-high camera placement and collapsed perspective -- as gorgeous and unsettling as a Czanne -- gather power over the duration but time itself is the master's most potent weapon
In this exquisite merging of specific and universal infinite and infinitesimal Tokyo Story perhaps most clearly illuminates that Ozu is not the most Japanese of filmmakers but the most human
With its debt to Leo McCarey's 'Make Way for Tomorrow' Yasujiro Ozu's 'Tokyo Story' is no less true shattering and not for viewers fretting about unsympathetic grown-up children
It soon becomes clear that they have planned their trip at a bad time it is equally clear that every time is a bad time
VIDEO ESSAY Yasujir Ozu's beloved masterpiece of postwar Japanese cinema speaks to audiences from all backgrounds because of the cross-generational familial truths that the prolific directorco-writer lovingly metes out
It's entirely possible that Tokyo Story isn't the best movie ever made But I suspect that it might be the most perfect
This extraordinary documentary shows Marjoe back in the pulpit for an expose of the church-and-tent revival circuit
A portrait of interior disconnect between authentic faith and cynical disillusionment
In  Sarah Kernochan and Howard Smith's Marjoe was enough of an eye-opening sensation to make news of itself and Oscar winners of its creators
For many complicated reasons fundamentalist Christianity in America doesn't look the same today as it did in  when Marjoe won the Academy Award for best documentary
Especially entertaining is this con man's exposing all the tricks of the trade from how he healed confederates feigning illnesses to the special gestures and vocal cadences designed to hypnotize his gullible followers
It's one of the most likable of all the Westerns directed by John Ford
one of Ford's masterworks a sublime crisp unpretentious western that doesn't wear its mythos on its sleeve
a simple straightforward film telling a simple straightforward story artistic in its design and execution and poetic in its telling
It's as gentle and warm a film as John Ford ever made and it follows a classic Ford theme the creation of a community in the west
Wagon Master is a good outdoor action film done in the best John Ford manner That means careful character development and movement spiced with high spots of action good drama and leavening comedy moments
Ford considered it among his personal favorites and a handful of Ford's biggest admirers consider it a neglected masterpiece I do too
This may be the closest Ford ever got to making a musical
The film manages to be suitably hard on the Nazi regime while providing one of the first sympathetic treatments of the German people
Litvak's intriguing account of US Intelligence operation during the last year of WWII was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar boasting a good performance from the young Oskar Werner as a sensitive and naive German soldier-traitor
It's most noted for being more sympathetic to peace loving German soldiers than are most American war films
Werner who served in the Axis forces during the war gives a magnetic performance
An outstanding production in all aspects
At once enigmatic deliberately obfuscating in nature and extremely revealing
Schell uses the limiting conditions-Dietrich did't let him photograph her-to an advantage resulting in a revelatory work that's more interesting because of the combative relationship with his subject a star wishing to keep control to the bitter end
The bilingual parrying between the withholding diva and her frustrated chronicler often seems like Sunset Boulevard re-imagined as a radio play with sex removed from the equation but marlenus interruptus aplenty
The result is a fascinating document not only of the star herself but also of the documentary as personal process
I think we learn much more about Dietrich than we would have if she had submitted to the usual paint-by-numbers fawning Biography Channel type of film
Well-made courtroom drama
The script and direction are handled with amazing restraint cleverly and carefully constructed heightened by Todd's inherently enigmatic image
One of three films Lean made virtually as star vehicles for his wife Ann Todd Here she manages to extend the range of her semi-hysterical screen personality into a flimsily forceful character who pits her amoral deviousness against rigid hypocrisy
Murder underneath patrician faades
This compelling character study is one of the three films David Lean made with his then wife Ann Todd
How many Iranian skiers does it take to tear down a mountain
A wonderfully offbeat comic allegory that maintains the sharpness of Kiarostami's humanist observations the film reads persuasively as a satire of masculine idiocy
A somewhat slight film but an enjoyable and sympathetic one
Sophisticated auds will enjoy this thoroughly modern spoof on masculine fixations played out in frank realistic dialogue
Although steeped in allegory political or otherwise the film is perfectly enjoyable and quite hilarious in its literal sense

It gets off to a fast start but dies in the stretch
it probably doesn't get the credit it deserves and it's really quite good
One of the duo's finest works together a rip-snorting screwball comedy that bounces from silliness to insanity with spectacular ease
Delightful Powell and Loy romantic comedy
Let's just say that Peter Tewksbury's direction makes the whole thing move like clockwork on the screen where it is done in delicious Metrocolor and that naturally no one gets hurt
Charming sex farce
Norman Krasna's screenplay from his Broadway legiter doesn't really get rolling until it has virtually marked time for almost an hour but once it gets up this head of steam the entire complexion of the picture seems to change
A fast frantic and sometimes funny sex comedy not unlike a thousand other sex comedies
Solid performances keep it entertaining even if one does occasionally chuckle at the outdated discussions of sexual mores
It's a cute little story of mistaken identity budding relationships and potential sexual awakening It's cute and it's not meant to be anything more
An exemplary ensemble piece with a script as warm witty and insightful as the performances
An alert unusually observant comedy of manners that is often very funny and cynical about human foibles but also comes with a melancholy underlay that's pensive and tender

An affectionate portrait of a cross section of humanity

Slyly written the intelligent social satire is surely acted and  confidently ably directed
With keenness subtlety and unexpected twists The Taste of Others reveals all And makes us smile at the revelations

a 'must see' for music fans and a necessary addition to the DVD libraries of all Dylan fans
A remarkably pure and powerful documentary partly because it's so simple The sound mix is crisp the black-and-white photography is lovely and the songs above all can be heard in all their earnest enigmatic glory
A fascinating documentary
If you care to see the brash young Dylan as he evolves onstage as an artist and moves on from his early folk success this is just a great film to see that
Penn's first film it is in many ways a key stage in the development of the Western
The character has rarely been portrayed as well as he is by Newman
The picture is a smart and exciting western paced by Paul Newman's intense portrayal
A good but disturbing psychological western well directed by Penn and acted in a strangely fascinating style by Newman
A close inspired study of Ford and Nicholas Ray and a decisive source of inspiration to Peckinpah Malick and Penn himself who looked at it again and saw Bonnie and Clyde
Penn's training in theater and live-TV drama eg Playhouse  shows the central performance is rehearsed into an anxious stir every line matched to an actorly decision a blocking cue
Boasting a strong turn by Paul Newman as Billy the Kid this disturbingly psychological technically innovative deconstructive Western marks the impressive debut of Arthur Penn Bonnie and Clyde signaling the beginning of the New American Cinema
Employs a warm and leisurely though never sluggish pace that's upfront about Bogdanovich's intention to take his sweet time tackling every topic of relevant interest
A feast for Petty fans and a joyous confirmation of the vitality of the collective creative process
Although frequently taken for granted Tom Petty has had more hits than Bruce Springsteen and stands as one of America's finest rock 'n' roll stars This movie is like ice cream you just can't get enough
Peter Bogdanovich's new documentary about the life and career of Florida-born rocker Tom Petty runs nearly four hours and never fails to engage or entertain
The band is treated reverently which will no doubt please fans but its eternal length may test the dedication of even Petty fanatics
One of the most beautiful audiovisual experiences of the year
Iceland's extraordinary natural beauty is as much a star of the movie as Sigur Rs's magisterial music and the all-local crew could hardly have done a more impressive promotional job had 'Heima' been commissioned by the Icelandic Tourist Board itself
Heartfelt and humorous if you're not pulsating during the Reykjavk finale you're probably kaput
Made with love for fans this is an indulgent but enjoyable film about the band and the places that have inspired their music
When the band and the film move in sweet simpatico they produce a few precious moments of transcendent grandeur
Sigur Ros' creativity and open attitude was at one with Iceland's ravishingly beautiful landscape
The elegantly composed shots of the island's broodingly lonesome wide spaces offer clues as to the group's widescreen post-rock sound Indeed their music comes to seem site-specific as environmentally immersed as the landscape art of Richard Long
The whole island seems to be in transition - huge developments threaten to deface the natural grandeur of the place - and this documentary may yet come to represent a vital memorial
Reverberates a sense not only of Iceland's people places and history but a sense of natural intimacy and intimacy with nature Capping it all is the band's best-ever 'Popplagi' a stunning  minutes that DeBlois matches with a shiver-inducing sequence

Director Vlacil does not try to romanticize medieval knighthood but creates an atmosphere of mysticism and superstition with excellent results
Episodic in structure the film proceeds like a folk saga but its flashbacks flash-forwards and abrupt cuts give it a hallucinatory quality

A wide-screen black-and-white feast for the eyes
Vlacil's historical epic is a sensory overload but I am certain of one thing I have just seen a masterpiece
A neglected masterpiece

An intelligently crafted celebration of introspection and decency
The mystery of Fischer's talent and torment adds depth to Searching for Bobby Fischer about a young New York chess prodigy who doesn't want his genius to ruin his life
Pomeranc is wonderfully real and wide-eyed as Josh with a raspy voice and slight lisp recalling Linus from the Peanuts cartoons

The film is one of the most sumptuous ever made in Europe
Two-plus hours of engrossing machinations and opulent scenery point the way to the pice de rsistance a -minute gala scene that the Almighty himself would approve as a luxuriant prelude to the Rapture
The Leopard is more than a tad too pleased by its own spots but in this case the source material and its director's intentions were almost accidentally an appropriate match
Watching The Leopard is like taking an indulgent bubble bath - albeit one in which the fragrance from the soap is overwhelming
Artistically drawn as if from an old master's hand
The film is a long rich sigh at the end of the day one that only Don Fabrizio can hear
A magnificent film munificently outfitted and splendidly acted by a large cast dominated by Burt Lancaster's standout stint in the title role

One of the great screen romances

VIDEO ESSAY A masterpiece by any standard The Last Picture Show  presents an emotionally apocalyptic reckoning of an America that has lost its way The subtext-the film was made at the height of the Vietnam War - is hard to miss
Classic American film has heavy themes and sex
The Last Picture Show is indeed one of the greatest movies ever made although I hardly think the scorekeepers were waiting for my vote to come in before they declared it such
The scene where Sam imparts his wisdom to young buck Bottoms may be the saddest loveliest moment in s American cinema And that's saying something
A sublime study of sexually charged ennui in a dying town in s Texas

It's plain and uncondescending in its re-creation of what it means to be a high-school athlete of what a country dance hall is like of the necking in cars and movie houses and of the desolation that follows high-school graduation
At first glance the movie is a faithful and skillful adaptation of the source but a second look at both the film and the book reveals some interesting divergences

Bergman glides beyond the mere telling of his story into a kind of hypnotic series of events that have the clarity and fascination of dreams Rarely have I felt so strongly during a movie that my mind had been shifted into a different kind of reality
A fitting introduction to the very personal cinema of this master craftsman not only because it exhibits Bergman's signature themes and stylistic devices but also because it is one of his most life-affirming films
Utterly enthralling
The director's most accessible and perhaps most personal film
It's a marvellously engrossing and thought-provoking film filled with dazzling dramatic set-pieces and witty knowing allusions to its creator's artistic conceits and deceits
Arguably Bergman's most accessible and upbeat work this childhood fable is magical personal and poignant in the way that other masterpieces of the genre are
One of the Great Films by one of the Great Filmmakers
An extraordinary drama about childhood and imagination as a passport out of dread and into mystery
A sumptuously produced period piece that is also a rich tapestry of childhood memoirs and moods fear and fancy employing all the manners and means of the best of cinematic theatrical from high and low comedy to darkest tragedy
The result is one of Bergman's most haunting and suggestive films
Immensely pleasurable
An accomplished masterpiece with excellent performances and rarely bettered direction
Bergman at his most compelling detailed and witty An astonishing and deeply rewarding achievement
Dickensian in its extravagant emotional power - with a hint of Charlotte Bront - and some Chekhov in its melancholy
During its three hours seasons come and go friends and relatives gather for funerals weddings and christenings and all human life is here
Sumptuous haunting and unusually tender a nakedly psychological 'in' to Bergman's earliest artistic impulses nothing else in his oeuvre addresses so directly his childhood escapes into fantasy as the by-product of a harsh Lutheran upbringing
This premiere of the original cut running at  minutes leaves room for more than a story of one life
A sprawling ornately constructed entertainment
One of the filmmaker's most personal and finely detailed works

Taut crime drama almost documentary in presentation
Shaw at his best and an obvious influence on Reservoir Dogs

Excellent little thriller
The film retains a fascination
Superior exercise in urban paranoia the superb location work of director Joseph Sargent goes a long way toward tempering the artificialities of the plot
Exciting suspenseful drama

a quintessential s New York picture full of prickly characters and urban tension

The original version of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three was made  years ago yet it retains a quality of cool that will remain long after people have forgotten the current version
This is gritty entertaining s filmmaking at its finest
Surly humor powers the movie as much as the ticking-clock premise does
Smart tense and funny Joseph Sargent's thriller is a product of its times reflecting New York in the s and part of a cycle of urban paranoia movie such as French Connection and Dog Day Afternoon
One of the decade's great defenses of New York
Though he's ready with easy charm Withers' sensibly jaded edge makes things interesting both tendencies may be reactions to stuttering since childhood
Much of the biographical documentary Still Bill about the singer Bill Withers is pleasant and even moving

Handsome and agreeable
The sensory disorientation climaxes in a freakout that wipes all your troubles away as well as anything else lying around in your head
The filmmaker Graham Reznick arrives with a bang in his feature debut the experimental horror film I Can See You
There's no way to explain that until you see the movie which goes from comic-realistic mode into full-on psycho meltdown with more terrifying adroitness than any other movie of this decade
Reznick's sound design effectively jangles nerves and two setpieces trumpet his visual prowess a languid lovemaking scene lit by indirect flashlight and a tour-de-force musical number
If you're looking for a narrative film this is not the pic you're looking for
Vikings has energy and a palpable passion for its subject matter that keeps you involved It serves as a nice general introduction that may stimulate viewers to learn more
Don't tell the kids that this documentary is educational They're likely to think it's an action-adventure

A big and friendly documentary that educates and entertains
The concluding message from this film appears to be that the Vikings were a rather dull bunch
These Vikings should be seen
A far more complex and satisfying essay on the subject of infidelity than the overpraised Hannah and Her Sisters
Ten years ago Husbands and Wives played second fiddle to Woody Allen's all-media split with Mia Farrow
Husbands and Wives is a comedy that explores serious themes - or perhaps a drama that is at times hysterically funny
Examines the ways the soul of a marriage can be sustained or shattered by change and conflict
Thought of as Woody Allen's artistic comeback A wonderful exploration of relationships
Woody Allen's latest movie Husbands and Wives is one of his best films and is a fascinating look at the breakup of two people
Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives is a very fine sometimes brutal comedy about a small group of contemporary New Yorkers
This is one of Woody Allen's best films to date combining some of his finest serious writing about relationships in the style of Hannah and her Sisters with humor that's all the more effective thanks to its dark edgy context
The acting is top notch
Allen in moderately experimental mode Good but not one of his best
One of Woody Allen's greatest films
With excellent performances Davis and Pollack in particular it's his finest film since Hannah and Her Sisters
Bleak yet strangely compelling look at modern romance
Too bad that the Allen-Farrow scandal erupted before this movie for it's one of Allen's best serio comedies with wonderful performances particularly Judy Davis but questions of life imitating art or art imitating life are inevitable while watching it
This last waltz between America's most prestigious film couple has a tone of muted regret not confession or sensationalism
It doesn't suffer from the compulsive tidiness of some of Allen's later movies -- the juices are flowing the hysteria is closer to the surface -- and in this looser more volatile atmosphere his extraordinary cast gets to soar
Allen's conception of character is as banal and shallow as ever but the lively performances of some of his actors and the novelty of the film's style make this more watchable than many of his features
Excellent performances from Pollack and Davis in particular make this one of Woody's finest of the s
In all respects this is a full meal as it deals with the things of life with intelligence truthful drama and rueful humor
Smart sensitive and packed with quality performances
With its shifting moods and its fairy tale symbolism of youth and age sexuality and death Valerie and Her Week of Wonders is part opaque folk tale and part Gothic horror
If you aren't too anxious about decoding what all this means you're likely to be entranced
A born director like Mr Jires can be forgiven a lopsided beauty that still commands full attention
There is no clearly-defined story the film's logic is that of the subconscious its images those of the Gothic fairytale and the psychiatrist's couch and its overall effect is stunning
This confounding carnivalesque coming-of-age fantasy is as beguiling as it is beautiful as subversive as it is strange
A sensuous often suspenseful fable saturated with shades of Sigmund Freud Lewis Carroll and the Marquis de Sade the horror comes in the form of actual traditional fanged vampires who can shape-shift and cause all kinds of deadly mischief
A confounding surreal dream-like film
The persistent idiosyncracy of vision -- saturated colours dramatic angles and deep shots framed by intervening branches and cobwebs -- fashion a little world that is fully realised within its own terms and will haunt many a viewer
Lovely to look at there is some social satire but this works mainly on a level of myth and magic
Valerie And Her Week Of Wonders enjoys a richly deserved place in the international canon of timeless coming-of-age stories
Viewers willing to just accept Valerie's beautiful surrealism will probably feel their time was better rewarded than those who will need to have it all figured out
Like the best fairy tales Valerie is voluptuously suggestive a bit dangerous and perfectly legible on its own subterranean terms
Moments of pure and frightening clarity mixed with images that can't be reconciled with any kind of reality These dreams don't offer coherence but rather a strong deep feeling that can take hours to shake
It remains a rapturous near-indescribable work of cinematic art
The cinematography is unforgettable
While Messrs Powell and Pressburger may have a picture that will disturb and antagonize some they also have in Black Narcissus an artistic accomplishment of no small proportions
Beautiful technicolor film with a slow-moving but intriguing plot
In a breakthrough role as the new nun Deborah Kerr heads a superb cast including Flora Robson and Jean Simmons in one of the most stunning color films ever made deservedly winning the Oscars for cinematography and art design
Sexual tension hangs in the air as the wind blows and native drums beat but it's on a visual level that the film excels
It might be the most beautiful film ever done in Technicolor
Theatre this Michael Powell film most certainly is as stressed by the gothic melodrama of the story and the acting the studio setting with its beautiful backdrops and vivid colours and the most deliberate of characters and events
You could say it's the most sensual nun movie ever made
Production has gained much through being in color The production and camerawork atone for minor lapses in the story Jack Cardiff's photography being outstanding
Powell's equally extravagant visual style transforms it into a landscape of the mind -- grand and terrible in its thorough abstraction
Powell and Pressburger created a film that still feels light years ahead of the opposition
Run don't walk to see this  classic from Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger
Colonial hubris nunsploitation  an unforgettable movie
A  English film classic about the challenges of desire faced by some nuns in a new mission in the Himalayas
Michael Powell was right when he called Black Narcissus an erotic film but the attraction is pure Pygmalionism
There's something truly unearthly about this place of howling winds yawning chasms and atmosphere thick with temptation Sanctity it will be proven is no match for sin
The Archers at their most carnal-bonkers-sublime
The natural colour is beautiful but more the rhythm of camera movement is recurrently used in combination with an overtinting of the whole scene at significant dramatic moments to produce an emphasis we have not seen before
This is a landmark of Hollywood-on-Thames trompe-l'oeil

It's kind of reassuring to see good old-fashioned dirty politics practiced with as much gusto as they are in the Oscar-nominated documentary Street Fight

James is his own worst enemy in the documentary behaving in public as a near caricature of Boss Tweed But he won and is now serving out his fifth term

The documentary is simple and strong and small Its grit lifts it above its mechanical shortcomings

he cumulative punch of Kieslowski's achievement -- a narrative visual and aural knockout -- sends one staggering out of the theater dizzy with the delight of being challenged to think and reeling from the artistry of a master filmmaker at work
Not an earth-shaking theme to be sure but this is art-house cinema of a very traditional kind and its pleasures are familiar rather than compelling
The finest of three classic films Red is unforgettable
The last segment of Kiewsloski's Three Color trilogy Blue White is the jewel in the crown meditative and mystical as the others yet warmer and more accessible in large part due to Jacob and Trintingnant's appealing performances

a beautiful film both emotionally and philosophically not to mention aesthetically
the most densely and deftly woven of the three films

Reed one of Britain's finest directors made his name with this haunting lyrical masterpiece about a doomed fugitive
This is Carol Reed's breakthrough film as a director
Odd Man Out is a picture to see to absorb in the darkness of the theatre and then go home and talk about
It's amongst British cinema's finest crime dramas
Well-directed melodrama Doesn't work on a 'tension' level but is worth a watch
Carol Reed's first great postwar film
Suspense gives way to metaphor in a stark thriller that hints at the work to come from master Carol Reed
Fascinating but imperfect
a rich noir treat - and Mason has the acting chops to make even a rapidly fading near mute half-corpse compelling to watch
Reed's take on the material is innovative letting realism blur into an anaemic soul-searching delirium Camera trickery is used to mind-bending effect and Odd Man Out's hallucinatory tone is often astonishing
Carol Reed has made his film with deliberation and care and has achieved splendid teamwork from every member of the cast Occasionally too intent on pointing his moral and adorning his tale he has missed little in its telling
This may be Reed's most pretentious film but it also happens to be one of his very best beautifully capturing the poetry of a city at night
This is not director Carol Reed's best film ranking behind The Third ManThe Stars Look Down Outcast of the Islands Night Train to Munich but it impressively displays Reed's command of image and atmosphere
I really enjoyed the dark atmospheric cinematography and a wonderful large cast The movie kind of wanders away from itself in the second half but I mostly enjoyed the places where it rambled
Carol Reed's Odd Man Out is one of the best political thrillers ever with a top notch turn from James Mason
What begins as an exercise in realism that includes an exceedingly quiet civil robbery sequence become increasingly expressionistic as it goes along
It was the rat-tat-tat releases of 's Odd Man Out good 's The Fallen Idol better and 's The Third Man best that marked Carol Reed as a world-class filmmaker
haunting and remarkable and utterly uncompromised
Shadow and rain and snow blur in glistening corrosion for a very long Irish night
This film puts Reed high in the first rank of directors It is not a great tragedy of deep-searching characterisation but it is a compelling drama of the chase geared to an unlagging tempo
The grief we see among those who loved him is brief yet palpable But the emotion we're left with is more uplifting
Witnessing him defy long odds gravity and death is a thrill even the uninitiated should find his unresolved father complex of interest
McConkey is simultaneously engaging and frustratingly superficial
It's not about why he was such a thrill-seeking risk-taker but about appreciating his success in living life on his own terms
His life journey was brief but breathtaking so it's fitting that this first biographical portrait of Shane McConkey matches the same description
Death and the right to choose to die will always inspire fierce debate and Miele doesn't try to solve that argument Instead it quietly emphasizes that there can be a grace to passing away no matter the circumstance
A virtuoso masterpiece from a director who has instantly made herself one to watch
An intense study of a woman whose faith in her job assisting suicide erodes
Honey could be about anything at all and still demand and hold your attention that the narrative is as moving as the film is aesthetically precise is an added delight
Driven by a no-nonsense ethos the film avoids sentimentality the same way its main character avoids sentiment
A thought-provoking moral thriller about a euthanasia activist in Italy
Golino shows impressive confidence behind the camera tackling a complex story with patience and empathy
The film shies from directly addressing anguished existential questions It is finally a story about the puncturing of one young headstrong woman's personal belief system
A visually stunning superbly acted film with an intelligent and timely screenplay about the right of the human being to make the ultimate decision ending one's life
Miele's  small achievement is in trying to understand the life-and-death choices of two people who aren't as certain about what they're doing as they initially appear
The title character of Honey is a fascinating and complex figure and Jasmine Trinca inhabits the role with a detached intensity that's thoroughly compelling
director Valeria Golinocreates a subdued character study of a young woman's awakening to the brighter side of life
Trinca delivers a marvelously unfussy performance rendering her complex character gradually along with the effects of the opposing forces that tear at her
Seek it out
Honey is never really laid bare as a character her helpless beseeching customers leave a much deeper impression
A smart engaging universal drama
Ilo Ilo is filled with sweetness humour and humanity so assured and accomplished that it's hard to believe this is a first feature
Chen scurries his handheld camera around the apartment and neighbouring streets like a tyro Truffaut He could be making Les Quatre cent coos
Anthony Chen puts modern Singaporese cinema on the map with this beautifully observed and gently comic family drama
A lovely intimate drama of family dynamics under stress offering an intriguing peek into previously unseen Singaporean middle-class life
Low on feel-good pizzazz but absolutely brimming with love and respect
This sympathetic and engaging drama is deceptively gentle in its insight - compassionate yet unsentimental
With evocative performances especially from the two women and a nicely modulated sense of nostalgia Ilo Ilo marks the emergence of a promising new cinematic voice
Anthony Chen a Singaporean writer-director with a half-dozen shorts to his credit makes his feature debut with this vividly characterized domestic drama
It's a simple straightforward character-driven drama reminiscent of the American indies that made their mark during the s
This quiet little domestic drama from Singapore reminds us films can achieve near-impossible heights and depths of intimacy and empathy
The crowded compositions convey a sense of life in the dense Asian city-state but also the intimacy of this semi-autobiographical story
That Ilo Ilo is set  years before the global financial crisis gives it a small sad prophetic power
The midsection's a little flabby forcing us to wait for certain plot elements to line up before the third act can begin but on the whole this is a solid transition from shorts to feature-length storytelling
Thankfully never sentimental and wisely resisting an easy happy ending Ilo Ilo is a surprisingly satisfying import
Chen builds his case not with sentimentality and obvious plot points but through everyday life -- showering doing laundry dropping the boy off at school phone calls
A low-key gentle observant family drama that resonates emotionally with intimacy
A gem
Perceptive and tightly built and anchored by such fully human characters
Ilo Ilo deals with that perennial dilemma of the middle-class working parent how to deal with the live-in nanny who begins to usurp your role
A nose-to-the-ground crime thriller that also doubles as a wide-ranging portrait of official corruption in the Philippines On the Job has little trouble delivering the genre goods
Combining street-level crime with political corruption On the Job owes as much to Scorsese as it does to Philippine current events
The film manages to create some moments of genuine nervous tension but is undercut by its split storytelling
Despite the relative flatness of the characters - their relationships to one another are more archetypal than particular - the film is as heartbreaking as it is heart-stopping
Matti's primary order of business is regularly serving up tense stylish action sequences and he proves more adept choreographing those than sorting out the convolutions of his parallel plotlines
Makes up in character development and action shots what it lacks in narrative innovation
Even at its most incomprehensible the propulsive thriller On the Job is never less than arresting
Matti uses this setup to show the rot in Philippine society and it's often compelling stuff - filmed mostly on dirty streets and in moldy ramshackle buildings
On the Job is a sturdy and sophisticated crime drama from the Philippines that takes a pretty gruesome situation and enriches its presentation with lots of human detail
On The Job is a chance to see the original messy thing
A great premise solid acting and some really interesting shots from director Matti make this well worth watching
This is a film whose signature image might be a bloody middle finger in the midst of a very lethal intersection shootout
an audacious trawl through the gutter of Manila's political structures evoking the very best conspiracy thrillers of the s while remaining utterly contemporary and local
It's easy to see how inspiring he could be as an artist and how tragically addictive the insanity of combat becomes when the engagement and desire to understand run that deep
The film is more powerful and haunting thanks to the ample footage incorporated of Hetherington himself a cheerful soul even when faced with evidence of unimaginable cruelty such as photographing those blinded during the war in Liberia
A warm fitting capstone for a man who saw the best in people during some of the worst circumstances and helped notably reshape notions of war photography
mostly a biographical film honoring the man and his work  while also highlighting two questions often ignored in discussions of war and war photography
Junger  brings intimacy and personal insight to his film but doesn't give into the temptation to make it a eulogy
Sebastian Junger who worked with Hetherington on the celebrated doc Restrepo paints a biographical profile that often speaks eloquently to the unique nature both of his late friend and of war itself
Hetherington's portrait-like approach to his subjects is itself a form of cinema
Unsurprisingly considering the circumstances this is less a meticulous study of photojournalist's art than an privileged and emotional look at the life of a friend and colleague
This is chiefly a celebratory piece  It is more than that however shedding light on what it means to be a journalist in a war zone
There is plenty of footage of Hetherington So much you wonder if he wanted to leave a part of himself behind should the worst come to the worst
A stirring lament for the late great photojournalist and some-time film director who was killed in action
One imagines the charismatic Hetherington once met would be unforgettable Junger's film is a decent heartfelt tribute
With its conventional archive-plus-talking-heads format this film is less radical than  but Junger articulates a number of subtle and unexpected ideas about Hetherington's work and about combat reporting in general
There is a sense of intimacy and a warm humanity shining in all his work and this is an eloquent moving tribute
His desire to understand conflict his gnawing away at the question of what young men get out of violence sets our own brain whirring
On the one hand dark and disturbing and on the other almost satirically funny
God Loves Uganda approaches this intersection of faith and politics with some fairness and a good deal of outrage
Those who demand pure objectivity from their documentaries may stumble on God Loves Uganda which never pretends to be impartial probably because it's next to impossible to do so when tackling this topic
Colonialism is alive and well in Uganda How the evangelicals use their superior wealth and power to force their sexual politics on a weaker nation
A scary documentary about the efforts of the Christian right to achieve in Uganda what they believe is their God-given right to lead that African nation
Williams' alarm is balanced by his measured observation of a group of twentysomethings from the Kansas City-based International House of Prayer
Credit must go to the filmmakers for presenting this in a fair and balanced way covering the full story with remarkable restraint
A disturbing expose While not as powerful as the recent Call Me Kuchu with whom it shares several commentators this is a valuable companion piece
Cultural imperialism the new crusades and the Christian Right wreaking havoc in Africa are unmasked But this tip of the iceberg inquiry begs for deeper digging into US capitalism's economic designs and how gullible US celebrity outrage kicks in too
what Oscar-winning director Roger Ross Williams presents in his documentary God Loves Uganda is a unique disturbing case of what could arguably be called spiritual exploitation
You'd never guess the subject matter of God Loves Uganda from its innocuous-sounding title
A powerful polemical documentary that preaches to its secular choir
Watching this film will leave you with some dispiriting questions about America and its values
God Loves Uganda charts the rise in persecution and intolerance in the African nation as America's Christian right takes its anti-gay fight to new territory
The frankness with which the director's subjects open up about the intentions and their beliefs is as alarming as the charm they turn on to win over the faith-starved locals
What's especially chilling is how unapologetic evangelical leaders such as Lou Engle and Scott Lively and the missionaries they send to spread the gospel in Africa are when they equate the sin of homosexuality with that of murder or theft
The salient trait of God Loves Uganda is its evenness of temper
The depiction of moral imperialism is frightening and infuriating
The moment could not be any timelier for this movie
A vitally important film that hopefully will also serve as a reminder to the US LGBTQ movement that complacency about our hard-won freedoms is far from being a global thing Far from it
A soft-centered child's-eye view of alienation toughened by fine acting and Hlne Louvart's full-bodied photography
Here's a story of refugee life from the perspective of a brash and attentive kid one just discovering - and often rejecting - the political realities grown-ups accept
Like Antoine Doinel in The  Blows Tarek has a way of using defiance and sarcasm to make himself seem smarter than any ostensible authority figure
When war or other disasters strike children suffer the most Uncomprehending powerless they can only endure
Gently comic life lessons emanate from horrific warfare in this measured and poetic mother-and-son drama
When I Saw You perhaps comes a little close to cliche sometimes perhaps it's impossible to watch guerrilla scenes without thinking of Woody Allen's Bananas but there are great moments and vignettes
Palestinian filmmaker Annemarie Jacir's second film is slight yet significant - and because of the situation in Syria timely - story about a boy whose courage inspires hope among the hopeless
Political without point-scoring Jacir remains true to a child's-eye view with Asfa's delightful exuberant performance always upfront
An earnest piece of social realism from a child's point of view
Visually splendid doc has a narrow scope but will charm bird-lovers
Birders makes a wealth of species even more readily available and close-up
Kimball behind the lens captures extraordinary images of these birds he lists them by the way in the credits Equally enrapturing are the birders themselves
It is a relatively short but luxurious film about birds and the people who watch them and the way that nature finds a place in the city and in its citizens
Bird watchers will find affirmation and even explanation for their avocation People who can't tell a towhee from a titmouse will still wonder at the beauty of it all
A slight but handsome nature documentary
A revelatory little film
Birders vividly captures the distinctive colors and markings of a vast number of bird species and the equally individualized personalities of those watching them within the confines of Central Park
An engrossing tour of this little-known subculture and unlikely habitat in the center of densely populated Manhattan
In Birders by contrast nature is one big entrancing show a world of tweets without tweets
A well-measured docu-character study
Perhaps on its deepest level Blade Runner explores  a theme as old as Genesis and the myth of Prometheus and iterated in Paradise Lost Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and in Blake's arcane visionary mythology
The single most immersive and tactile world ever created for the cinema
It's a quest movie - where one thing leads mechanically to another to another to another There are no twists It's noir only in atmosphere and expressionist lighting schemes
Another chance to savour its pure unhurried strangeness beginning with that bizarre vista of  LA with four tall buildings mysteriously belching fire-plumes into the night like apocalyptic oil rigs
Scott's visionary thriller makes the acid rainneon-drenched Los Angeles of  a far colder more violent and depressing place
Blade Runner is a film set  years hence made in the style of  years ago Ridley Scott said of his celebrated science-fiction noir Perhaps that other-worldly retrofitted look is why it seems ageless despite being set in
This remains an astonishing achievement a Dystopian sci-fi epic that is also one of the best film noirs of recent times
Ford with his Star Wars cachet was Blade Runner's top-line draw but it's Hauer's movie all the way his shimmering replicant providing the tonal touchstone for Ridley Scott's severally reworked masterpiece
Fahey-who died in  at age -is depicted as a unique explorer who was in constant search of his next sonic revelation
If you didn't already admire his music you may be searching for more of it after seeing this documentary
Cullingham reveals both psychological and aesthetic reasons for Fahey's determination to remain a remote iconoclast sheltered by mystique
As Pete Townshend says at one point here Fahey created a new language for the guitar
An impressive documentary on the guitar artistry of John Fahey who described himself as a spiritual detective
Newcomers and fans alike will find a lot to treasure here
a fairly run-of-the-mill character study that's elevated by star Amrita Acharia's spellbinding performance
Culture clash amplifies the array of life options open for all women and lends this quietly compelling film an extra layer of difficulty for a young Pakistani-Norwegian woman as she attempts to navigate them
How to be a mother a lover and an aspiring actress all at once
Anchored by a splendid lead performance from Amrita Acharia but a little directionless otherwise
Haq has the storytelling style of a lawyer calmly presenting the facts of a case leaving it to the audience to decide whether to focus judgment on Mina or unsympathetic circumstances
Acharia's electric performance is impressive while director Iram Haq brings an insider's sympathy to the protagonist's plight
Actress Iram Haq makes a solid directorial debut with this tale of clashing cultures
I Am Yours is a pensive perceptive study of a woman adrift whose expectations of a relationship are never quite matched
This glorious  debut feature by Mexican writer-director Claudia Sainte-Luce takes one of the most shopworn melodramatic premises and makes it feel spontaneous and new
The familiar premise is done with enough intelligence and heartfelt conviction that it rises above its potentially clich trappings
Claudia Sainte-Luce's semi-autobiographical indie has a knack for subverting stereotypes without making a big deal about it
Sainte-Luce shows great assurance for a first-time filmmaker and if she's able to capitalize on her talent going forward The Amazing Catfish will be looked at fondly as ground zero for a worthy career
If there's a certain depth missing in The Amazing Catfish the film brings forth the small-scale pleasures and poignancy of an ambling short story
Writer-director Claudia Sainte-Luce heralds herself as a new talent to watch with The Amazing Catfish an outstanding debut of tremendous heart and appeal
This movie has a lot of personality its own voice and it delivers its message straight and direct maybe a little too direct Full review in Spanish
This is a cogent and courageous account of a complex and continuing situation
As a reflection of the mood and struggles of those seeking democratic change it is immersive and visceral even if its up close and personal approach means that the political sphere is rendered in broad brushstroke terms
It's an astonishingly intimate account of an ongoing revolution seen from within the heart of historic social upheaval alarming uplifting empowering
If like me you watched all this on TV the ongoing turmoil began to feel like a distant abstract blur Noujaim takes us inside this history by centering on three protesters each from a different background
What does a revolution feel like from the inside I'm not sure we'll ever get closer than The Square an electrifying at times heartbreaking documentary from the Egypt-born Harvard-educated documentarian Jehane Noujaim
Epitomizes nonfiction film not just as a way to deepen knowledge and understanding but also as an art form
The camera becomes a revolutionary running chasing breathlessly jittery up in the face of interrogators
Jehane Noujaim recaptures the movement's spirit while exploring the realities of the post-revolution period in her fascinating new film The Square
If the resulting film is unwieldy - five editors five additional editors and six assistant editors are credited - it also brims with angry urgency
The success failures and political wrangling of the rebellion is examined in great detail by a very brave group of filmmakers
The film succeeds in its quieter moments
The Square doesn't slack for a minute Quite a voice Quite a film
An essential chronicle
A stirring tribute to democracy and those willing to fight for it
Noujaim's film attests to how quickly joyous weeping in the streets gave way to sectarian arguments over the army's role and fissures in promising alliances
One of the very best documentaries of
What does a revolution really feel like You learn the answer in The Square an extraordinary documentary that puts its cameras on the ground to take us in the heart of the troubled betrayed idealistic and sad movement for democracy in Egypt
Unflinching violent but excellent docu on Arab Spring
Jehane Noujaim's ground-level account of the Arab Spring from  to mid- in Cairo's Tahrir Square has heart wit poetry and fire
Nothing short of literature
A touching deeply affecting look at the ongoing impact of loss
This film doesn't just revisit an atrocity it moves through it and finds meaning in it
Seeks to restore the Matt Shepard of his friends' and family's memories and in so doing return a human symbol to a state of ordinary but beloved individuality
A heartfelt documentary about homophobia a brutal murder and the legacy of a promising young gay man
Proves to be the most intimate and detailed account yet of Shepard's life death and cultural impact Director Michele Josue remains impressively objective for one who was so close to her subject
The heartbreaking but ultimately inspiring short life of a modern martyr is uncovered in this at-times nave but powerful documentary
Matt Shepard Is a Friend of Mine seeks to restore Shepard's humanity to his name to tell the story of the person who was murdered for being who he was
Matt Shepard Is A Friend Of Mine is a moving eulogy to a life lost but not forgotten
Long-in-coming doc offers an intensely personal look behind the headlines
The film is enough to prompt soul-searching among parents educators and the LGBT community on how to provide adequate guidance and support for LGBT youths
Josue's film her first is a work of raw unfiltered emotion
An almost unbearably heartbreaking documentary rehumanizes the LGBT icon and makes him newly tragic all over again
Filmmaker Michele Josue who knew Matthew does a fine job of reconstructing the crime and the reaction it provoked across the US and beyond
Josue's film is not consistently effective in bridging her personal story with Shepard's well-known legacy but there are striking moments that explore the limits of forgiveness
Moving documentary brings hate crime victim to life
Director Michele Josue depicts the personal side the famous victim of hate she knew as friend
There's nothing new here in terms of documentary form and there are too many filler scenes shot from inside cars driving down Wyoming's highways But this is an important emotionally powerful story
If the director wanted to rehumanize Shepard she has succeeded Her other goal though worthwhile was not so easy to accomplish to make sense of a horrific event and move on
This is a film that attempts to portray Shepard as an ordinary young man who happened to become a lightning-rod figure But most of all it gives its characters - and its audience - a chance to reflect
The main thing writer-director Michele Jouse wanted to do was to give a voice to those who are still mourning Shepard and allow them to share their stories Through them we get to know the person behind the tragedy
Like any pop cultural tradition the videotape has its diehards who are the diverting guests in Josh Johnson's new documentary
Incredibly fun doco that delivers the perfect hit of nostalgia for generation-VHS while educating the uninitiated on an important part of pop culture history
Rewind This is both a history lesson and love letter to a format which should prove to be a must-see for all cinephiles that came of age during the VHS era
Lively history makes some good observations about video and the culture it enabled
Rewind This is a charmer of a documentary that will strike a chord with audiences who have grown up with the format
Rewind This didn't delve into every corner of VHS I might have wished but it introduced plenty I'd never thought of
There's nary a trace of ironic detachment or condescension here which is exceedingly rare for any depiction of geek culture
Perhaps the best compliment I can pay the film is to say that it made me want to go down in my basement and dig through all those old VHS tapes that I have boxed up
This unabashedly nostalgic doc serves as a potent reminder of VHS' pivotal role in the history of entertainment even if we've all moved on now Well most of us
Johnson's savvy authority ensures that Rewind This will leave many film-and-video lovers begging for more
The film is ultimately less interested in giving an objective overview of VHS' history than in paying loving irreverent tribute to some of the strange subcultures that sprung up in the home-video world
a fascinating funny and focused journey through our recent - and rapidly changing - cultural memory lest we forget
The film is elevated above the average 'these are a few of my favourite things' documentary by its willingness to take on larger narratives around the social economic and literary significance of the genre all in a fully accessible way
It's affectionate and educational with enough visual evidence to act as a time machine bringing viewers back to an era of movie-watching exploration and physical media worship
A hilarious and utterly excellent look back at a time where movie collecting was more of a sport and treasure hunt than a matter of simple point and click
It ultimately takes a high place in the ranks of DC's direct-to-video line exemplifying the kind of stories tailor made for this format
Another flawed but fun animated film featuring the Man of Steel
A worthy addition to the Superman library
Feels cinematic despite the fact that it wasn't made for the big screen
Superman fights learns life lessons in animated thriller
Hankin's film finally makes the indigenous variety of deadlock particular to New York politicos seem as quaintly comforting as a buttered bialy
An uncommonly engrossing and articulate documentary
This interesting but undeniably bottom-line-minded chronicle of the rebuilding at Ground Zero provides a unique look at civic strife and a city's spirit
A documentary that features forthright interviews with major players and gives a good sense of the infighting and pettiness without getting bogged down in it
This alternately amusing and heartbreaking documentary coherently chronicles the endles process of rebuilding Ground Zero
A fascinating portrait of municipal and private interests trying to make headway in the charged atmosphere of devastating personal loss and wounded national pride
A vital and in certain ways even cathartic documentary It's a story about ego and hubris yes but also the better angels of our nature
Acres is a  documentary but not that kind of  documentary  it explores the stew of hope frustration ambition and PR spin-cycling involved in the decade-plus effort to rebuild what terrorists so quickly tore down
Ingratiating if too short record of a Hollywood institution anyone would be happy to attend
An agreeable visit with comedy titans who clearly cherish the opportunity to regale their peers with war stories and opinions about the state of comedy today
The appeal of Lunch might be limited to Hollywood-nostalgia buffs but they will be enthralled not only by the stories told but also how they're told These guys are still some of the sharpest wits in town
It's worth pulling up a chair
Low-key and low-tech Lunch coasts on the earned wisdom of pros who know how to work a room
It's inspiring to see greats like Reiner still sharp and funny or even a very frail Caesar rousing himself on cue to do a bit of shtick
More of a buffet spread than a single plate But every morsel is worth a taste
Chang examines the historical and spiritual significance of fruit and environmental concerns that affect sustainable cropsthe personalities that emerge are fascinating
Amid many haphazard details and much talk of obsession the lush work by cinematographer Mark Ellam is something of a guide sensuous and outstanding his macro lens showing the very female wonder of fruit
Not only very interesting but also incredibly beautiful  it's a fun documentary and that's a treat almost as rare as some of the exotic fruit it showcases
Delicious doc is a notch above average foodie fare
The Fruit Hunters engages and educates in a way that is almost as rich as the miraculous bounty which forms its subject
Hearing the personalities describe the transcendent tastes of different fruits has me wanting to hop the next plane to Hawaii just to taste a water apple
Cukor and Donald Ogden Stewart's evergreen version of Philip Barry's romantic farce centreing on a socialite wedding threatened by scandal is a delight from start to finish with everyone involved working on peak form
O charme do trio principal e a inteligncia dos dilogos permitiram que o filme envelhecesse maravilhosamente bem
Approaching it as fairytale with moral--Hepburn meets her prince but gums it up and need to rediscover her own humanity--Cukor directs with stylish elegance that serves the play perfectly it's one of his masterpieces
Is The Philadelphia Story about cutting Katharine Hepburn down to size
George Cukor gives it the royal treatment with a splendid supporting cast
The smarties are going to relish Philadelphia Story a lot more than the two-bit trade
With such a stellar cast a fine director working in the type of picture he did best and some genuinely witty dialogue this film has all the ingredients for a great comedy
Every time Katharine Hepburn Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart connect in a scene we hear the happy ding of quality champagne crystal
In short The Philadelphia Story lifts the daily drudge into a charming never-never land with complete footnotes excusing its existence And besides it's a good entertaining show
Romantic comedies are rarely this fabulous
Screwball romance is lots of fun for older kids
How well all is pulled together and comes off is more glaring when 'The Philadelphia Story' is compared to its fluffy but fangless  musical adaptation 'High Society'
Spoofs and plays sly homage to Clifford Odets' earnest socialist dramas
The film is a Hepburn triumph and moviegoers who resent the theatre's habit of requisitioning their stars may feel that Miss Hepburn's time on the stage has not been spent in vain and that she simply prepared herself for this achievement
Just sit back and enjoy romantic comedy at its most sublime
Cukor's direction flawlessly picks up on defining character traits and all the intricate detail makes watching this movie feel like you're an invisible gatecrasher at the Lords' party
Utterly beguiling funny and romantic
Still a sparkling delight
This is close to perfection with Katharine Hepburn repeating her stage triumph as spoilt socialite Tracy Lord
This frothy theatre adaptation dates from the period when Hollywood had pretty much perfected the art of the romantic comedy
Seems forever young
This should be required viewing for today's droves of would-be memoirsts in film or any other medium and otherwise is simply a must for anybody who likes great movies
An enduring masterpieceTruffaut's autobiographical fiction shows an admirable equanimity by depicting the highs and lows of boyhood Blu-ray
The  Blows one of the initiating sparks of the French New Wave ultimately boils down to the film's trendsetting coda perhaps the most exclamatory question mark in movies
Alive with the joy of filmmaking for its own sake
It's streetwise stuff shot in a vigorous on-the-hoof style but also full of joy both in its blissfully comic moments and in Doinel's telling passion for moviegoing
Distinguished by its naturalistic quasi-documentary approach and an extraordinary central performance from the -year-old Jean-Pierre Laud this is a blisteringly authentic story
One of the first glistening droplets of the French New Wave
Vibrant visually exciting and emotionally resonant
Henri Decae's black and white photography helped Truffaut enormously but what the director himself provides is a sense that though there is no easy answer to the problems of growing up there is a hope that will never be wholly denied
It's a cornerstone of the French New Wave and one of the greatest movies about childhood from anywhere ever
What is there to say about The  Blows that hasn't already been said
Franois Truffaut's iconoclastic feature debut and one of the most enduring examples of the French New Wave
Truffault's masterpiece Timeless and true heartbreakingly sad
Truffaut brought a fresh and piercingly honest portrayal of troubled youth to the screen In many ways Antonie Doinel is not only the cinematic embodiment of Truffaut but also the French New Wave as a whole
Truffaut's ode to his childhood is an engrossing watch that is alluring in its simplicity and brilliant in its direction It flows nicely at its own pace never allowing melodrama to ruin its realistic and voyeuristic atmosphere
A rich and fascinating look at youth and its fleeting joys
Francois Truffaut's debut film not only galvanized the Nouvelle Vague movement of French cinema but he also generated a personal filmic idiom that he would elaborate on for the rest of his career
Childhood's frustrations for Truffaut are never far from its lilting delights
Truffaut imbues the movie with the irrepressible energy and optimism of youth
A treasure
A Great Depression film so blackly off its rocker it seems in many ways to be of our time more than its own
Scintillating screwball comedy One of the best
Hugely popular in its day this is witty romantic comedy with barbed social commentary
There may be a sober moment or two in the picture there may be a few lines of the script that do not pack a laugh Somehow we cannot remember them
A silvery romp
The ultimate Depression-era satire of the idle rich and tribute to the noble poor This popular theme was never more devastatingly realized than in this opening sequence
One of the most enchanting and poignant screwball comedies of all time La Cava's zany film reflects the zeitgeist of the Depression and is supremely acted by William Powell Carol Lombard and the rest of the ensemble
The film has lost some of its allure over the years but it's still streets and streets ahead of the addled whimsy favoured by latter-day Hollywood
Its whimsical winning nature still comes through
Director Gregory La Cava was a master of the sustained comedy
William Powell and Carole Lombard are pleasantly teamed in this splendidly produced comedy
Gregory La Cava's improvisational style received its highest critical acclaim for this  film a marginally Marxist exercise in class confusion during the Depression
God but this film is beautiful
A screwball masterpiece
A brilliantly executed screwball full of both madcap humour and bitter satire
My Man Godfrey emerges with that evasive quality that is not skillful playing writing or direction but something that mysteriously adds itself to these things and makes a tip-top picture
There's a charm to both Powell and Lombard making the film transcend generations It's a cute movie that has fun with levels of wealth in society and sibling rivalry
Hasn't lost an ounce of its thematic resonance even after all these decades
Gregory La Cava's warm and giddy carousel a raucous burlesque with a beautiful still center a lighter and tarter savior fable than Capra's concurrent transmutations of the Gospels
Director George Sluizer unfolds his story with non-hysterical -- but nonetheless unnerving -- precision Vanishing is refreshingly free of manipulative scenes involving running bath water jagged-edge cutlery and bunnies in the saucepan
Utterly original a wonderful little foreign-language gem
doesn't defy rationality but rather turns rationality itself into an instrument of horror
Creates one of the most frightening movie monsters in recent history
It is a superbly done suspense yarn
Okay but wildly overrated and predictable
Mr Sluizer whose direction has the spooky precision of nonfiction crime writing and whose matter-of-factness makes the characters seem quite real builds a disturbing horror story from seemingly modest beginnings
Banality has never been so harrowing
A potent haunting and impressively nuanced thriller
Too too chilling
An intense thriller
Brilliant unforgettable DutchFrench suspense flick
A masterpiece of psychological horror
Somewhat erie and efficient but never really gets under your skin
Exquisitely creepy
Sluizer's direction is seamless throughout effortlessly juggling domesticity and damnation as it ploughs inexorably towards an appaling dnouement
Worthy of Hitchcock
VIDEO ESSAY George Sluizer's spellbinding adaptation of Tim Krabb's horror novella The Golden Egg is such an expertly layered suspense thriller than it serves as a textbook archetype of the genre
The explanation is so darkly compelling-and ultimately so chilling-that The Vanishing has earned its reputation as one of the scariest non-horror movies ever made
Sluizer adapted the film but he takes a more non-linear approach than the book which heightens the story at strategic moments to build suspense
Yasujiro Ozu's  film inaugurated his majestic late period it's here that he decisively renounces melodrama and indeed most surface action of any kind and lets his camera settle into the still long-take contemplation
With no one looking but the camera Hara's face registers anger jealousy and humiliation all in the space of a few seconds
Ozu's characters don't seek ecstasy not because they are afraid of it but because they are brave enough to accept compromise
One of the best two or three films Ozu ever made
Late Spring exemplifies Ozu's rich mature style an apparent stylelessness of patient lifelike rhythms unobtrusive camerawork and credibly subtle performances DVD
welcome respite from mindless dispassionate cinema
Exquisite  What little plot there is in Late Spring is adorned by Ozu's Zen-like meditation on objects surroundings and the Japanese concept of mono no aware -- the ineffable resignation to the reality of life as things are
the work of a master
Ozu's camera is observational rather than intrusive even when we get something akin to a close-up it never feels like it's invading the character's space
One of the director's favorites
Late Spring is along with Tokyo Story Ozu's greatest work
An early indicator of Ozu's late-career greatness his remarkably subtle family drama Late Spring finds him at his expressive peak
Haiku-like in its title its interest in the undramatic silences between scenes and its enfolding of human behaviour within nature Late Spring offers tenderness in the place of melodrama and patient truth in the place of sudden revelation
impermanence forms the film's true subject - and it is Ozu's ambivalence towards it as though he wants both to board the train and to stay on the platform that ultimately gives Late Spring its bittersweet resonance
Ozu trains his trademarked fixed camera on the deceptively simple story of a father and daughter and finds in it nothing short of the whole wide world
Ozu's low camera position helps the audience relate to his characters and his almost-always static shots portray the sturdy demeanor of his characters
Sadness is tempered with humor even to a 'good luck' wallet found under a policeman's nose just as tempered by the unknown and unforeseeable life itself is sweet as well as bitter
Movies resurrect the beautiful dead Susan Sontag once wrote and there's no better way to commemorate Hara than to watch her in Late Spring a film in which she is heartbreakingly vibrant
Each shot in Late Spring is striking on its own the mature Ozu belongs to that rare category of filmmakers whose work can be recognized from a single frame
Yasujiro Ozu's early domestic masterwork has been given a gorgeous restoration which makes it even more treasurable-if possible-than ever
Probing unsettling and visually compelling The Conformist treats its audience as adults never opting for easy closure
The Conformist isn't just a triumph it's one of the greatest movies ever made
One of the most referenced and extraordinary films in cinema history
Bertolucci's film has the compelling quality of a bad dream
A beautifully imagined portrait of moral and political cowardice
All hail the revival of one of Bernardo Bertolucci's best films
One of the finest sex-and-politics thrillers ever made blending sharp humour with riveting suspense
Talvez o melhor filme de Bertolucci esta obra-prima magnificamente fotografada por Storaro  to formidvel em sua construo esttica e narrativa que cada praticamente todo plano se presta a anlises longas e profundas
The Conformist is Bernardo Bertolucci's immaculate work of cinematic art about the conflicted mindset of a man who carries out Mussolini's fascist ideology
The art house meets Hollywood neo-noir in Bernardo Bertolucci's The Conformist a film that isn't recognized enough as the masterpiece that it is
The Conformist is celebrated for cinematographer Vittorio Storaro's tumbling autumn leaves but its emotional impact involves a tumbling soul
Photographed by Vittorio Storraro it's a mlange of the sensual haziness of 's European art-house fair and the high-contrast anxious angles of film noir
Few films really deserve the term 'masterpiece' but this one does
Bertolucci's boldest and most expressive film
The unsettling blend of images and ideas in this movie cannot satisfactorily be disentangled or decoded and it's the very strangeness of Bertolucci's masterpiece that has made it so influential in cinema history
Visual splendor reigns supreme in Bertolucci's dazzling historical dreamscape
It's yesteryear remembered with a combination of nostalgia and repulsion a queasy combination that defines the film and gives it a kind of hideous allure
It's a superb performance by Trintignant whose presence is the film is physically passive even as he tries to play the confident intellectual leader of men
The one and only quintessential all-time masterpiece that trades extensively on its ideal viewer's knowledge of the history of th Century interior design
heightened exaggerated distorted the world reimagined by the filmmakers as something familiar yet not It is magnificent
Honest observant and subtle
A smart generous and believable coming-of-age feature even the comedy is the comedy of recognition rather than belittlement
Cone's feature is among the best of a recent spate of dramas observing American Christian life
Flaws are ultimately overshadowed by Cone's excellent young actors particularly Torem burrowing deeply into her character's zealotry and anguish about being left behind
Hovering over the narrative is the fear of the domino effect that change can enact the dread that one person's queerness may perhaps expose everyone else's
The Wise Kids is a guileless exploration of the growing pains of sheltered innocents whose reticence and sincerity evoke s small-town values
Wonderfully intelligent coming-of-age story filled with resonant questions of faith and done with a rare subtlety which honors the audience
Chicago indie Stephen Cone took a quantum leap forward with this moving  drama about a Christian youth group in small-town South Carolina
Religion may permeate this film but it does so because it permeates the characters' lives The Wise Kids features some nice surprises and some solid acting and editing
Hustwit gorgeously enhances the talking-head commentaries of architects policymakers and other progressive thinkers with spatially clean static-camera compositions -- this time in God's-eye panoramas of earth's ant farm
Maybe this is the best title they could muster -- it's a stinker depressing or depending on your mood vaguely danceable Fortunately the documentary itself is grand
A lively if schematic overview of city planning at its best and not so best
Even viewers with deep knowledge of modern urban planning are likely to learn something from the carefully selected images and thoughtful interviews that make up most of Urbanized
The documentary at times is weighed down by statistics and shop talk but Luke Geissbuhler's smartly rendered cinematography saves the day
A digestible globetrotting primer on the future of cities filled with bracingly plainspoken professionals and practical optimism despite a few sketchily drawn crises
Urbanized is a fast zoom out to the big picture The colonies or hives in which we arrange display and support our lives
At the very least Hustwit drives home the urgency of radically rethinking city life as the world population tops seven billion
Concerned inhabitants of the global village would do well to track this one down
A showcase for many conflicting viewpoints
The film ticks off a fascinating blend of dos and don'ts for a century that will see even greater numbers of people packing into urban centers
A rich ambitious exploration of the ways our surroundings are shaped and the subtler ways they shape us
A good and great-looking overview of urban planning
One of Bergman's early triumphs
Thanks to international distributors sensationalizing its sexual frankness this bittersweet drama of ill-fated first love helped establish Ingmar Bergman as a filmmaker
His first film with Andersson shows a developing ability to probe the psychology of a rich vital woman without losing his objectivity
Subtle but sharply observed it remains one of Bergman's most watchable and rewarding dramas
A tender yet unsentimental account of a love affair that turns sour
Bergman would be no more adept a pornographer than he would be at filming hip-hop but his camera did stare at the human surface with an intentness unmatched since von Sternberg rhapsodized over Marlene Dietrich
Bergman's tale of heedless teenage love is a sort of neorealist Rebel Without a Cause -- except that sex is acknowledged and the outlaw is a girl
More than  years after its first screening in America Monika arrives in New York again to light up the screen this time without a trace of impropriety
A fully realized Bergman psychodrama rather than an early model for his later work
It's one of Bergman's most natural carnal and accessible films
A sensual elegy along the lines of Ovid's 'Amores' and very much a movie about photographing Harriet Andersson
Bergman's key international breakthrough
Bergman fans will discover that it's not a typical film of his and is rather more realistic than his later films and some would call it minor But by any standards it's an excellent film gorgeously made and emotionally powerful
In the annals of Early Bergman Summer with Monika is The Big One The irony is that it's among the slightest of his works
It's highly respectful of the work on which it is based yet also a solidly entertaining effort in its own right
DC's theatrical releases may be facing a bleak future but titles like this remind us that their direct-to-video line is alive and well
If you're a Batman fan just hearing the words The Dark Knight Returns likely gets you excited so this film was probably already on your radar
Extremely violent animated addition to the Batman story
this first half is essentially throat-clearing before the operatic finale The pacing seems abrupt and rapid
An expertly drawn primer on the soft dictatorships that constrained five different countries and the peaceful revolutions that sought to expunge them
More inspirational than informative which is not to slight the importance of inspiring similar movements
A Whisper to a Roar is a vivid documentary with unusual access to the key players in the geopolitical dramas it recounts
Ben Moses' documentary argues that even thwarted and deeply flawed elections are empowering because they engage ordinary citizens in the political process and challenge the self-defeating apathy engendered by opting out of the process
A powerful documentary that ties together the heroic and ongoing efforts of democracy activists in five countries and reaffirms the human spirit's innate desire for freedom
Imhoof's film is remarkable in its close-up photography The bees loom large like creatures from some mutant planet dangle together in a delicate chain and fill the air floating like unusually vivid dust specks
Markus Imhoof makes bees more important than they have previously seemed
What's really frightening about Honey isn't what a hive of angry bees might do to us but what we've done to them
Oblique narrative aside you can't beat the film's eye-popping visuals
Astonishing macro-photography captures the bees in all their surreal beauty presenting a tribute to nature's messenger of love and a warning of what might be lost
Informative and occasionally scary
Feels slightly diffuse in its analysis
Summer's blitz of apocalypse movies has nothing on this bee doc
Elegant handsomely shot and often instructive and its remarkable extended close-up sequences of bees' social structure are fascinating
You come out of the film none the wiser as to where the bees have all gone But you still learn a hell of a lot about them
A fascinating informative and startling documentary that explores the disappearance of the honeybee
An interesting and interestingly laidback film an almost restful look at honeybees and the way they are kept and cultivated across the world
There is a lot to be learned from this thoughtful film as you marvel at the amazingly intimate images of colony life
In all More than Honey makes for surprisingly stimulating fare
Stinging but positive film about bees
Eye-popping photography should draw viewers to this thoughtful revealing doc
More Than Honey is a phenomenally well-researched and thorough study of bees and their complex influence on human civilization and an in depth investigation of the honeybee colony collapse disorder
It is the elegance of its images that sets it apart from previous doomed bee documentaries The footage of individual animals going about their business is a sight to behold
Markus Imhoof's bee documentary is so stuffed with surreal tableaux it makes your head spin
Imhoof's globetrotting odyssey is more concerned with contemplation than investigation
anyone with an adventurous palate  tolerance for highly artificial colours  flavours might fancy a sample from this wilfully tasteless menu It melts on the mouth without leaving anything to chew on - but overall it's a bit of a damp squid
For all its absurdity Dead Sushi is truly a film made by a bunch of like-minded Japanese Lost Boys who are all just trying to have fun and make each other laugh and it shows
In the world of Japanese extremism cinema Noboru Iguchi is an Iron Chef - and his lastest delectable treat pleases just like the rest
For those in the mood for a midnight movie extravaganza that shows attention to the particulars of the palate and reverence for creature attack cinema Dead Sushi is just cracked enough to work
If splattery Japanese weirdness is what you're into there's no denying that this flick delivers the goods and then some
A fascinating must-see docu
Piercing
It's a powerful testament to how far we both have and haven't come
Booker's Place A Mississippi Story is in equal measure a look at two families the ongoing legacy of America's recent past and an essay on one man's moment of transformative courage
Rediscovered historical footage plants the seed for a moving beautifully crafted Civil Rights doc
A kind of excavation and investigation of Mr Wright's actions as a piece of civil rights history
Booker's Place A Mississippi Story doesn't flinch from asking tough questions
Documentarian and subject past and present blur together like bleeding watercolors in Raymond De Felitta's gripping memoir
With empathetic craftsmanship the film unspools as a brief history of hatred that may be recognizable to anyone who lived through the th century or has been paying attention in the st
The exploration of these issues is precisely what makes the documentary so compelling and relevant even half-a-century after the film that inspired it was broadcast
Clarity is a forte for a documentary Director Raymond De Felitta has captured a time and place both past and present but one wishes he had pushed a bit more for truth
Booker Wright's interview becomes a window into the life not only of one man but of a whole culture that one hopes lies mostly in America's past
An interesting and entertaining if often sad documentary inspired by a  NBC special 'Mississippi A Self Portrait' that brought trouble to one of its participants a popular waiter at a 'whites-only' restaurant
A heart-felt movie that gives you a good idea of how backward a state is Mississippi
The film tells a story of another America which seems most primitive foreign and far away now but it was really not all that long ago in old segregated Jim Crow Mississippi
Morrison and Frisell infuse the film with warmth and where appropriate a touch of wit causing its subject to breathe anew
Even in comparatively conventional mode Bill Morrison's work still benefits from the poetic potential of nature's repossession of its own elements
A striking experiment in music and moviemaking
The Great Flood works as a wordless narrative of human endurance
The movie on its own would have been nice but with this music it's sublime
Most of all it's a unique highly immersing audio-visual experience that would be as at home in a museum as it is in a movie theater - and that's a first-order compliment
Destined for a long life in museums and history classes alike this is cinema as art and a classic
Somehow it feels wrong to enjoy a story about so much suffering
Brief title cards orient the viewer to the history but the moving combination of sound and image ends up being more profound than any explanatory narration could ever be
The footage itself isn't always well-preserved but director Bill Morrison incorporates it into the overall effect
The damage gives the images an appropriately mud-spattered post-disaster appearance sometimes the splotchy jumpy degradation transforms these smalltown flood scenes into abstract animated splatter paintings
Having taken the flood out of time Morrison plants it firmly in space - or as firm as any dreamscape can be He's made a sort of travelog and it's destination is inundation
A lightly argued but forcefully illustrated look at the historical and philosophical interplay between the artisanal process and political art
The premise of this brief portrait sketch is as modest as the standard-definition full-frame format in which it was photographed
Offers up compelling portraits of practicing artists intelligently probing their status as socially conscious image makers
The entire history of politically inspired printmaking unfolds in Manfred Kirchheimer's admirably serious hands-on documentary
There is no mistaking Mr Kirchheimer's convictions or his understandable love for the creators here past and present
Put succinctly this is the greatest film ever made dealing with the connection between art and radical politics
What the film lacks in logic and scientific plausibility it makes up for in the philosophical questions it raises
The ideas McClean puts on screen are creative and original And his technical skill is outstanding He shows a lot of promise in other words and the film's worth checking out
This is the first feature from writer-director Joe McClean and he has made a debut that is admittedly uneven but not without promise
The turmoil in the friendship of the trio grounds the film in humanity when things get too theoretical
Joe McLean makes a memorable directorial debut with this mind-blowing sci-fi reminiscent of such inscrutable screen classics as Memento and The Matrix

Riveting docu explores rights of girls women in India
The Waiting Room doesn't have the answers but it does tap into the heart and soul of what's so critically at stake
This is human drama at its most intense and universal This is the rare film that can change the way you think and see the world
The Waiting Room is beautifully filmed and masterfully edited but feels too careful and polished to have the emotional impact of activist filmmaking
For hard-edged documentary snap with the all-important local angle it would be hard to beat this film
recalls Frederick Wiseman with voice oversan engrossing eye opening look at the mess American healthcare is in the heroics involved in propping it up and the endurance necessary these days to be sick without insurance
Documentary filmmaker Peter Nicks provides us with an eye opening work about the life in a day of an ER that makes any reality TV pale in comparison
If people believe Mitt Romney's assertion that emergency rooms are a solution for the uninsured this is a powerful rebuke
The movie observes the general misery of needing serious medical treatment and the particular awfulness of needing medical treatment you can't pay for
Eloquently portrays the faults and limitations of the American health care system even as it punctures some of the most toxic stereotypes surrounding it
The galvanizing chronicle of a -hour period at the emergency room of a public hospital in Oakland California
Both a depressing indictment of a system that prioritizes health care based on insurance coverage and at the same time uplifting if only because of the extraordinary professionals who keep it going - barely
The level of frankness and vulnerability of those featured suggests just how compassionate a filmmaker Nicks who acted as his own cinematographer must be
One of 's better documentaries the gut-punch effectiveness of Peter Nicks' film lies in its forthrightness and how it avoids speechifying
Nicks nets moments that are at turns horrific and touching redemptive of those seeking treatment and the workers who provide it where no one else will
Grim but enlightening perhaps required viewing for those who care to debate themselves blue about a crisis they'll never fully understand
A dramatic and inspiring look at a piece of the US health care problem
A moving portrait of people doing their jobs under very difficult circumstances - and in virtually every moment we see doing them with efficiency wisdom and compassion
It's a vivid portrait of the crisis in health care policy with the caregivers and clinic itself as much on life support as the sick people
If you want to understand how the American system of health care delivery works for people without employer-sponsored health insurance I can think of no better introduction than watching Peter Nicks' documentary The Waiting Room
In a year of exceptionally strong documentaries The Waiting Room is one of the most urgent and effective
This is less a film about terrorists than an intimate portrait of boys growing up in a toxic environment
Four childhood friends from the slums are recruited by Islamic fundamentalists and turned into suicide bombers in Nabil Ayouch's affecting strongly edited Horses of God
Horses Of God does a creditable job of depicting the sort of toxic environment that breeds terrorists gradually divesting its young men of any real hope for their future
Ayouch depicts the sprawling ramshackle Sidi Moumen slums with fluid camera movements some of which ascend unexpectedly from street level to the rooftops the apparent result of cameras on remote-controlled aircraft
Nabil Ayouch's film allows us see how young suicide bombers--horses of God as the man in charge of their mission calls them--might deserve our pity
A compelling contemplation of the roots of Islamic terrorism in poverty and hopelessness
Ayouch film casts a sharp gaze on tragedy and the larger socio-economic issues that beget fanaticism
Director Nabil Ayouch does a remarkable job of putting you inside this brutal world from the garbage dumps that serve as playgrounds to soaring aerial shots of the endless tin roofs that form their neighborhood
Quietly powerful haunting unflinchingly honest and character-driven
Years-long grooming provides explanatory social context  in how marginalized kids   get caught up in organized violence to get a sense of control over powerless lives
Horses of God is one of the most forceful entries in a growing body of cinema that interrogates the causes and effects of terrorism nationalism and fundamentalism in the Arab world
Anyone seeking to establish an incubator for suicide bombers could hardly improve on Sidi Moumen a slum on the fringe of Casablanca
Backed by the astounding beauty of the Himalayas their struggle to reach the peak is healing for them and illuminating for the rest of us
PTSD documentary provides a poignant portrait of wounded Irag and Afghan War vets as they scale Himalayan mountain
A less than inspiring documentary about extremely inspiring individuals High Ground is worth seeing for what it shows rather than how it shows it
An impressively restrained documentary
Brown takes advantage of the opportunity to present a broad array of feelings less on the nature of these conflicts in particular and more on the mindset of the soldier in war - and the difficulties faced when no longer in the midst of the conflict
Brown  translates a collage of experiences - some desperate some hopeful all tragic - into a first-person commentary on the malign reverberations of war
High Ground is a moving documentary that is both the film it presents itself to be and something more
Moving account of  disabled veterans on an expedition to climb Mount Lobuche in the Himalayas
The feisty actresses clearly relish their vivid roles
An affectionate twist on a classic tale of lovers on the lam sprinkled with renegade hints of Thelma  Louise Cloudburst is a life- and heart-affirming journey
It's a delight to see Olympia Dukakis and Brenda Fricker superb talents and Oscar winners both share almost every frame of Cloudburst
Features one of the funniest bawdiest most memorable scenes I've ever witnessed in a film Despite the formulaic elements it still feels like an original
In its peaceful moments it's a gem but the wild stabs at wacky comedy are usually groaners a shame in a story that's so smart and savvy when it isn't showing off being dense or winding down to a painfully pat ending
A rough-edged Olympia Dukakis steals much of this comedy road movie about two ageing lesbians who go to Canada to get married Enjoyable but unremarkable
The two actorsbring out the best in these two women in spite of the plot lapses and odd tonal shiftsyou believe wholeheartedly that these two are deeply in love and Dukakis and Fricker gift their characters with a real bond of intimacy
An impactful allegorical apolitical naturalistic film about Tibetans treated like dogs and losing their identity under modern Red China's brutal rule
It's both a sly piece of ethnography and a social satire that reads like a cosmic jokeright up until its climax makes the chuckle catch in your throat
While the rigid framing and wispy plot create an unfortunate inertia they also magnify the occasional whimsical moment
Old Dog has the look and feel of a documentary which adds senses of urgency and immediacy to a tale that moves at a languid but never boring pace
Minimalist in its aesthetics and soundtrack quiet and deliberate in its plot but nonetheless familiar--endearing and a vital addition to the small but growing Tibetan cinema
To the eye of the Occidental moviegoer nothing much goes on Underneath however roils a cultural genocide of generational cultural social and political upheaval
Stunning mixture of understated social criticism and minimalism a la Kurismaki
Fletcher clearly relishes cinematic flourishes but applies them in broad superficial strokes
Full of quirky absorbing characters and performances Fletcher's debut is a hugely enjoyable East End western and a lesson on how to avoid the excesses of the Brit-crim-com
While eschewing the mockney flash of his Lock Stock mucker Guy Ritchie Fletcher's kitchen sink is brighter than most filled more with Shane Meadows brass than Ken Loach gloom
One of the best British films of the year from the mind of Dexter Fletcher who emerges from his presentingacting days as an exciting new writingdirectorial voice
Overall Fletcher should be as pleased as punch with his debut efforts
An impressive directorial debut from Dexter Fletcher thanks to a superb script heartfelt characters a great soundtrack and terrific performances from a fine ensemble cast
Works well when it sticks to its filial bonding story but falters when it brings on singularly unconvincing neighbourhood drug dealers in an attempt to increase tension
There's more than enough good stuff here to whet the appetite for Fletcher's followup
The story won't win awards for originality but Fletcher has created a film that's both charming and true to life
Fletcher has fashioned a deft likeable addition to a crowded genre the cockney comedy thriller It will be good to see how he fares when he moves on
Directed with flair by Fletcher Wild Bill is more affecting family drama than conventional gangster pic and it's an outstanding achievement
Why can't all British crime dramas be so well written and well acted and have a splash of comedy as confident as this
Gripping intense and with a razor-sharp wit this marks Fletcher as one to watch
Suspenseful exhilarating and genuinely moving galvanised by strong performances and breathlessly orchestrated action sequences
It wears its lion heart firmly on its sleeve with bouts of good humour and sense making it impossible not to be drawn into its rugged charm
Fletcher injects new marrow into some creaky bones
Dexter Fletcher doesn't overplay the cowboy angle Instead he puts most of his efforts into creating a believable dynamic between the father and his sons and it's in this tangled skein of shyness suspicion loyalty and love that the film's heart lies
An unusually affecting movie with pitch-perfect comic moments a lot of heart and a beautiful final shot that acts as a crowning achievement for Creed-Miles
There's a lot more to this likeable crime flick than your usual dunderheaded Danny Dyer vehicle
With a concept and influences consciously in mind fine performances by Creed-Miles Poulter and Williams and approving cameosFletcher is able to put his best foot forward in this creditable debut
Vividly captures a year in the life of eastside Detroit's Engine Company
Who needs the fake fires and explosions of theTerminator series when you can see the real thing in this doc
The endless scenes of burning buildings and macho posturing merely provide an action-driven context for the filmmakers to deal with more personal topics like loneliness and resiliency
Burn captures the danger and yes excitement of putting out blazes as well as the futility of dousing flames in a city rife with arson-and the struggles to maintain adequate funding in a wrecked economy that hits the public sector hardest
The film makes you thankful for members of this macho breed who relish risking their lives to save others
Burn is not just a celebration of these wonderful involving fighters of fires and so much more that threatens survival It is also a tribute to the decent working class and firefighters everywhere who impact so many lives
If Black America is an internal colony then Detroit is its epicenter Hence the more than coincidental ties between this powerful documentary and Pontecorvo's masterpiece
the dynamic on-the-fly scenes of danger and chummy stationhouse camaraderie are slowly peeled away to reveal a fascinating and multigenerational portrait of loss resiliency frustration and regret
An emotional character study of a group of heroic yet very human individuals
Directors Tom Putnam and Brenna Sanchez structure Burn in a brilliant way allowing viewers not just access to life behind the fire hose but to make personal connections with these men who act against the human instinct to run away from the flames
As powerful as Burn's images can be the Detroit firefighters tell their own stories about what's important to them their neighborhood connections their family legacies their pride in their fellows and in their community
These stories are moving but what really distinguishes the film is the sense of an entire city giving in to self-immolation
An action-packed look at the men who do their best to keep Detroit from going up in flames
Burn from directors Tom Putnam and Brenna Sanchez is a straight-up documentary about a year in the life of the Detroit Fire Department And what a year
Burn does some eulogising for a great nation that may never achieve that greatness again but it also celebrates the spirit of community that built it up
