Parents and grandparents shouldn't be surprised if afterward youngsters are sufficiently curious to Google info about the real-life Apollo moon missions that the movie playfully references
Works hard in an effort to recapture the fizzy thrills of action-centric Pixar flicks like 'The Incredibles'
For some Capture the Flag will just about scrape by on its honourable intentions and brisk delivery however what seems on paper like a vaguely educational distraction is merely another exercise in colourful chaos
Several of the characters are so grating you long for a lunar disaster to strand them as far away from planet Earth as possible
Capture The Flag has enough visual energy to get to the moon and back Alas the script blows harder than a solar wind
It's a feeble storyline and the film is only partially lifted by some lively action sequences and one or two Gravity-like scenes of the astronauts drifting in space
It may lack the finesse and charm of animation from Pixar Disney or DreamWorks but it's a decent yarn for younger kids who want something to watch on a rainy day or school holiday
Aside from a fleeting post-Minions Kubrick gag there's little here for the oldies and nothing that the Pixar generation won't have seen done before and better
So mind-numbingly stupid that any investment in the characters is next to impossible
Capture the Flag sits comfortably at the classier end of children's fare for the start of
There is an inkling of a better film here but something appears to have got lost in translation making this quite the forgettable voyage
This colourful animation tries a little too hard to get down with the kids
A good family film with a positive message Full review in Spanish
One of those films kids can see over and over again and adults won't have to suffer when seeing it Full review in Spanish
Great animation too bad the story isn't that great or original Still pretty decent Full review in Spanish
It touches on the subject of keeping families together successfully Full review in Spanish
The film entertains and will certainly be enjoyed by children and adults with knowledge in films and pop culture Full review in Spanish
A good effort that achieves it's low goals Full review in Spanish
The movie is dull right up until the point that it becomes completely characteristically bonkers with Miike trotting out some of his trademark obscene violence
Over Your Dead Body is a convoluted spectacle that sees Miike's visual prowess wasted on a puzzling story about life imitating art
two parallel narratives bleed into one another in a deeply irrational manner blurring the boundaries between theatre and film antique and postmodern actor and character the living and the dead
Evocatively shot and earns a few winces of discomfort on its way to a lurid finale twist What the picture fails to accomplish however is giving the viewer someone to care about relate to or understand
Instead of relying on frenetic insanity and buckets of viscera this movie sets an uneasy tone where tension slowly crawls to its peak
Over Your Dead Body will certainly appeal to Miike's hardcore fan base for his technical mastery of blood is on display throughout
It's clear from the get-go that the filmmakers have more commercial than creative motives here and their plot has the cracks to prove it
Propelled by a continuing series of quakes spread out over the entire state San Andreas is all forward momentum and non-stop action but with enough narrative focus to avoid letting the calamity totally engulf the picture
There are a couple of nice shots including one of a BART hurtling out of its tunnel and another of a naval vessel wedged between two skyscrapers seemingly lifted straight from the concept art but the real order of business here is destruction
Earthquakes hit California and The Rock teams up with his estranged wife to save their daughter That's pretty much it and that's all there really needs to be
Delivers what it promises unrelenting entertainment and pure action Full review in Spanish
San Andreas may have impressive special effects but without a well-developed human element or an emotional core it becomes a rather empty experience that fails to pull the audience into its tale of epic destruction
This movie didn't take much time escalating from realistic depiction of a disaster to giant numbing CGI spectacle
San Andreas picks its humans so carefully it starts to feel Calvinist in its approach to salvation as Ray Gaines becomes deus ex heli using the taxpayers' equipment to save his own family
San Andreas is nowhere near the best movie made this year Indeed it might be one of the worst But it is without a doubt one of the most unapologetic self-aware and entertaining romps of  And that counts for something
The main problem is that the film can't decide whether it wants to be a proper disaster movie or a Dwayne Johnson action vehicle
How much you enjoy the movie depends on how much mass destruction you can deal with and how much cheese you can stomach
You could certainly do worse and should be entertained enough despite its many faults
Summer's upon us and you could do worse than watch the undeniably appealing Johnson try to save the day while uttering the silliest dialogue imaginable
What Johnson does best probably better than anyone else right now is to draw attention to the absurdity even the impossibility of himself In a movie so invested on making him seem possible that performance so endearing and so smart gets lost
It's enormously entertaining thanks to the undeniable charisma of Dwayne The Rock Johnson and the wanton CGI destruction of all of the West Coast's greatest landmarks in -D no less
The plot the beats the character arcs They all seem like they come from a Hollywood build-your-own-disaster movie kit
Who'd have thought that the demise of several cities full of unnamed people would act as a perverse sort of marriage counselling for a couple in nuptial distress
So I suppose I would recommend this movie provided you know exactly what you're getting yourself into
Best Performance by a Semi-Retired Professional Wrestler in an Irwin Allen-styled Disaster Movie That'll be the day I go back to Annandale
It's an unintentionally comedic look at mankind's selfish disinterest toward anyone in danger -- except for family
It is nice to see a summer family film where for a change the emphasis is as much on thought-provoking story as it is on action
Bird's a consummate filmmaker He's crafted a movie that celebrates exceptional people prizes optimism over cynicism and ends with the idea that a better world is possible if we just try to find it
The road to Tomorrowland is paved with good intentions that leave you wanting much more out of this beautifully designed science-fiction fantasy that expects more out of all of us if Earth is to survive
Tomorrowland makes for a fun and exciting adventure
It's hard to say exactly who the audience is for this packed-to-the-brim sci-fiaction-adventurefamily romp
Tomorrowland is strong on character action and a general sense of wonder but it needs to take a good hard look at itself when it comes to tying up plot strands in a satisfying manner
Let's just say that the film is a self-reflective essay on the different way we look at the future in  than we did in  It also has some stern things to say about ignoring climate change -- in a very Disney sort of way
There's so much great stuff in this movie that doesn't even remotely hang together
The message of Brad Bird's latest is admirable and delivered well -- hoping to inspire young generations and shoot some life into the notion of optimism that cinema should really be all about
Tomorrowland boasts some excellent visual appeal but sadly it does nothing to mask the multitude of faults found in the story including a poor structure and a severely underwhelming conclusion
If you can get past its narrative muddle really irritating dialogue and a plethora of unanswered questions Tomorrowland offers a potent metaphor about the triumph of human hope and ingenuity Wish it were enough
It's really nice to escape into the gleaming piece of chrome-ornamented optimism that is the Disney brand but handcuffed by the happy ending edict Tomorrowland hits a hollow note in its final frames as it beckons the big exit through gift shop
A solid film with unclear intentions and an apparent lack of a primary protagonist
An bermensch philosophy melded with Disney's blue-sky pixie-dust cheerfulness
From the jump Tomorrowland is devoted more to looking good than being good
Loving a future that used to be better as Frank terms it a future imagined before cynicism was pervasive at least for cute white boys like Frank used to be the movie is predictably incoherent It wants an old future one that's long gone
Tomorrowland is a folly and a failure though there is something touching in its failure tied as it is to the vision and personality of Walt Disney himself
The year's biggest letdown Full review in Spanish
Bird takes the adolescent yearnings of kids raised up on pulpy Golden Age sci-fi and briefly gives them agency and texture
It's a modestly successful pure-hearted family blockbuster The story doesn't really match its ideals in the end but it's a fun enough ride while you're on it
Fisher's filmmaking aside from a couple scenes  that are nicely composed in long-take two-shots is too consistently flat to make the material spark
Let's see what Fisher does next
Sharp yet overdetermined Blumenthal doesn't breathe naturally - it's a comedy in a box Just not a box that everyone will want to open
Though a missed opportunity Blumenthal contains bits and pieces to savor
A limp facsimile of a Woody Allen ensembler set in a familiar world of New York Jewish intellectuals - minus only the wit and the intellect
Heralding the arrival of Seth Fisher as a voice to watch Blumenthal is much like its characters a frankly funny and original piece of work
Not all of Fisher's debut feature works but when it does the results are lacerating hilarious and surprisingly forgiving
Fisher is a fine actor but his movie is entirely derivative
The material being offered has been edited composed and made sentimental with the rigor of a political ad campaign
Rossier allows space for the man's culpability even as he convincingly shows that without de Klerk's involvement the struggle for black liberation would have been much harder and taken much longer
It is infuriating to watch de Klerk apologists insist that apartheid actually helped blacks
None of this is particularly cinematic  but it is engaging mainly because the stakes were so high and the statesmanship so delicate
Haphazard both as biography and historical survey the film asks more salient questions than it can answer in a rushed  minutes
Other Man reminds us how much there is to marvel at in the country's transition from minority white to black rule
Gillis clearly had some ideas for practical effects he wanted to create the plot is just an excuse to do them There doesn't appear to be much sincere interest in telling a story For this reason Harbinger Down plays like the world's longest demo reel
Ranks somewhere between self-consciously cheesy SyFy Channel fare and better-than-average direct-to-video product
Bad acting and atrocious dialogue is topped only by the cheap shoddiness of the practical FX this demo-reel flick is meant to show off Better they'd remained unseen
Harbinger Down brings the monstrous goods as expect yet struggles to tell a coherent story that's worth the practical effects success
Simplistic and obvious but it also does a fine job of emulating the late-'s monster movies we all know and love
A really solid and above average debut from Alec Gillis
Hire a hitman face the consequences Cheap thrills and lots of dark surprises
A grim grudging-buddies splatterfest featuring a few surprising plot twists and all the fixin's for a riveting cinematic experience
The emotional dynamics in domestic violence for the abuser and the abused are often too disturbing and complex to be treated as superficially as The Living does
An effective modern day noir
The Living is one of those unfortunate films ignorant of any world outside its author's head
The Living presents itself as a searing genre piece about domestic violence but it proves to be only a shell of its potential
The Living could be something kind of interesting if only it weren't trying so hard to emotionally goad its audience
While the film may end up exactly where you know it should Wormald keeps it resonant by becoming worse than the men he's seeking to expunge
There's so much thrown into Tip Top that nothing stands out
This police procedural is staged by the director Serge Bozon as a musical without music
Serge Bozon's smart surprising marvelously realized French crime-and-sex police dramacomedy distinguishes itself with trenchant plotting inspired framing and performances that honor true human feeling even as they lunge into the screwball
For the most part however the comedy feels forced as if Bozon is indulging a rather obscure private joke
An overwrought experiment in cerebral slapstick that misses more targets than it hits
The resulting clash of tones initially seems jarring but ultimately original and invigorating
Director Serge Bozon is not sure whether he intends a linear or non-linear sex rib-tickler or noir thriller a female buddy cop caper or a social comment Or all of them
Confirms director and co-screenwriter Serge Bozon as one of French cinema's true oddballs
Instead of finding one consistent tone and sticking to it Serge Bozon allows the wildly hilarious and the grimly serious to uneasily coexist exulting in the resultant clash
Peculiar and abrasive
One minute a tense police procedural the next a wacky Almodvarian sex farce this schizophrenic enterprise is more wearying than entertaining
This sui generis policier audaciously balances slapstick with a fiercely intelligent probing of the still-knotty legacy of France's colonialist past
As with the Golden Age American B-movies Bozon admires Tip Top's primary concern is not with identifying the bad guy but with smuggling in as much additional information as possible including televised images of the unfolding Arab Spring
The freewheeling narrative experimentation and cryptic social commentary recall s Godard but the vibe is Bozon's own
Sagrada plays like a video you might buy at the cathedral gift shop that outlines the history of the project
The only mystery here is why even for architecture geeks this documentary is duller than watching stucco dry
A stone-faced look at the most confounding fascinating and controversial edifice still being built today Stefan Haupt's documentary tours Antonio Gaud's colossal cathedral but never offers the spirit or thrill this weird wonder deserves
A sometimes pedantic mostly fascinating documentary about Barcelona's towering cathedral La Sagrada Familia which was conceived by Antoni Gaud in the late th century
The photography is impressive as well Haupt's camera moving gracefully through the interior of the basilica and ascending to its spectacular heights
A peaceful and gently stirring documentary that considers faith and architecture and human achievement in something like geologic time
Sagrada is a vividly informative documentary
Employing bursts of Bach and English-language narration this lulling informative documentary never fully grapples with its topic's complexity
Zurich-born Stefan Haupt however interrupts his rapturous tour of this basilica with lackluster interviews
Directed by Switzerland's Stefan Haupt in a deliberate unforced manner Sagrada The Mystery of Creation takes a satisfying three-pronged approach to this unique structure visual historical and reportorial
Stefan Haupt's 'biography' of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia is handsome yet bland
Fascinating Anyone with an interest in architecture history or religionspirituality will find much to appreciate
Mona Fastvold's consistently intriguing debut may leave audiences feeling it's all buildup and scant payoff
A darkly mysterious and extremely accomplished first feature The Sleepwalker suggests the things we lost in the fire might be much deeper than material possessions
The film soon settles into a confident well-staged groove primarily because of two unambiguously terrific performances
None of the characters is particularly likable or admirable leaving little opportunity for sympathy or curiosity to penetrate the constantly heightened air of psychodrama
The Sleepwalker distinguishes itself from most entries in this angst-ridden genre by way of superb writing smoldering performances and hauntingly beautiful imagery from first-time director Mona Fastvold
Among the many unanswered questions I ask Where do they find this junk and where do so many amateurs get the money to finance it
I was much to my own surprise engrossed in this story from pretty much the first frame
With strong assists from the cinematographer Zachary Galler and her ex-husband the composer Sondre Lerche Ms Fastvold previously a director of music videos has painted a resonant tableau of dysfunction
In attempting to subvert our expectations of the genre The Sleepwalker concerns itself with formal details and momentary pleasures that cannot mask the film's regrettable lack of thematic depth
The setup has mysterious promise but the film cheaps out on a satisfying payoff
If the finale was able to match the suspenseful buildup the scale might have tipped to make The Sleepwalker a remarkable accomplishment rather than a letdown
an assured first feature that seems to announce the arrival of impressive cinematic sensibility
A playful tone and passable performances can't overcome an unremarkable premise and predictable plotting
Whaley has given his actress too many dots to connect -- or more than is advisable No matter though because Meester with her natural easy fit into the role proves game and goes after those gaps with an indelible marker
Narrow in focus not terribly ambitious but elegiac and well-acted
Frank Whaley never gives these characters a humanizing moment outside of their default personalities which turns them into cartoon impressions of the worst of each class
Unsurprising given its laughably affected title Like Sunday Like Rain boasts what may be the most insufferably precocious protagonist in cinema history
A tenderhearted lesson in how friendship can be forged in spite of a great gulf in age class and IQ
Like Sunday Like Rain is so out of tune that even late-breaking attempts at emotion can't strike a chord
Perhaps the best picture Whaley has made to date able to find purpose and meaning in this friendship disrupting a formulaic structure with an earnest appreciation of personality
If only Whaleypossessed any singularity of vision perhaps this rote film would have had a similarly lasting effect
It's a bittersweet story that thins out toward the end as it turns too obviously sentimental but it's still a nicely etched tale of the intersection of two unrelated lives
Whaley nicely calibrates this wistful dramedy's emotional quotient never allowing sentiment to turn into sap He also smartly dials down Reggie's initial precociousness to reveal a kid who's deep resourceful and strangely sensible
Whaley aims high for this sort of material but his film sweet as it is gets a little too precocious
Whaley has made a provocative well-acted movie about infatuations that turn awkward but he struggles with the ending
Gossip Girl royalty Meester does opposite side of the tracks raw and real here when it comes to emotional domestic violence economic class divisions and youth financial struggles today But the incessant background music is this film's own worst enemy
A tender and heartfelt drama about the friendship between a -something nanny and her brainy -year-old charge
The same listless scenes play over and over park restaurant cello etc with odd editing lurches between them
Since the movie is one long build-up to a reveal it offers a lot of time to learn to hate Brondo and everything she represents
Argentinean import Penumbra is a slick teasing well constructed genre offering that rather skillfully exploits audience antipathy toward its bitch-on-wheels protagonist
Bearing in mind that the title of the film translates to 'shadowy indefinite or marginal' I leave it up to you to decided whether or not patience is one of your virtues
There are several reasons to stay with Penumbra until the bloody end Cristina Brondo makes this bitch-on-wheels likeable She is a remarkable actress And the directors Garcia Bogliano brothers know how to build suspense C'est bizarre
The film's ending is a letdown but it's a blast to root for such a brassy rhymes with itch heroine
There's talent here but Villanueva like a young artist still influenced by his elders needs to find his own style or he'll become a skilled yet unexciting copyist
Simmons is a capable helmer presenting a few choice moments of bloodshed and intimidation to make a pile of clichs sit upright for a change
A healthy amalgam of The Descent and Feast with a hint of Night of the Living Dead
Animal has enough carnage to appease more forgiving horror fans but despite a quick pace and brutal kills it's repetition that truly kills this beast
One wishes there was more creativity put into exploring the animal of the title and the lore behind this species' existence but there is no denying the crafty skill and above-average production values with which Animal has been made
People go into the woods and they don't come out Add a man-eating whatsit and you've got a horror movie Not a very good horror movie But certainly genre fans get what they want some old-fashioned blood-and-guts Chomp chomp
ultimately devolves into just another forgettable straight-to-video horror flick that predominantly features characters hiding and running within all-too-dark environs
Big Driver is slimmer in content as well as form than Misery but it is nonetheless gripping
It's too simple and straightforward for its own good
It's a powerful film - not because its story of a vengeful female will shine a light on social injustices but simply because it grips viewers and doesn't let go until the credits are rolling Maria Bello is a pain-stricken wonder
A few horror-story cliches seep in but with Bello playing a character who is strikingly unglamorous and at times not even sympathetic Big Driver should deliver for its audience
Such commercial considerations notwithstanding in the wake of a recent run of cynical Lifetime movie topics from Saved by the Bell to Brittany Murphy Big Driver runs into another creative dead end
Solid star turn eerie production values even a killer ending Nice symmetry Steve
An often toothless and ridiculous rape revenge thriller
Like some of King's other tales it loses its way devolving into a rape revenge fantasy whose potency is diluted by silly gimmicks like a talking GPS system with a mind of its own
If only it weren't such a disturbingly retro and sadistically sensationalized take on the subject If only it were any good at all
You've gotta really be willing to throw logic out the window to enjoy Big Driver a revenge-thriller based on the Stephen King novella But as TV movies go it isn't that bad and certainly the cast is excellent
Strong performances but a run-of-the-mill sitcom
A rigidly predetermined film that runs on the fumes of hackneyed plot points squandering at nearly every turn a humanistic study of a family's struggle to maintain a tenable bond with one another
The film's surface naturalism and visual grit simply cover up a screenplay that's as full of crap as the average recent Hollywood comedy
A terrific Irish dramedy about clutter family solidarity and an -year-old woman's response to a major gift she is given
Life's a Breeze is ultimately about as cutting and memorable as its title
Life's a Breeze is a small film with a considerable amount of charm Comic and idiosyncratic it takes a warmhearted view toward its protagonists while still seeing them for exactly who they are
A small sweet film the sort of unexpected pleasure movie fans often find at a small film festival or on some second-tier cable channel
As amiable and windswept as its title promises for better or worse
Set amidst long unemployment lines Daly freshly finds the heart within the slapstick and social criticism when he focuses on the oldest and younger generations
Flanagan and appealing newcomer Kelly Thornton as Nan's teenage granddaughter deliver the only tolerable performances probably because they don't say much and like us just observe the silliness on display
Life's a Breeze spins a sitcom plot into passable yet predictable entertainment
The mundane story is not much but the likable characters are fun
Despite the occasional emotional overtones this is really a very light and enjoyable comedy
Yes if it wasn't for the salty language this might just be a TV movie But I liked it
The scary Halloween house at your local amusement park is child's play compared to the extreme haunts that fill this uneven but intriguing found-footage horror flick
it really does expose how class-based so many of our horror tropes are
While there's much to admire the film also falls victim to the pitfalls that plague many found footage movies
IF the filmmakers had made a documentary about haunted houses I might have liked The Houses October Built Instead they opted for a knockoff of The Blair Witch Project What a mistake
If you're relatively easily scared or are in a theater full of people who are the film might be good for a few screams But only if you're the patient sort
An incredibly sloppy found-footage flick that's awful enough to give Halloween a bad name
The Houses October Built proves one of the more successful attempts at the found-footage horror flick since Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones
Never transcends a predictable narrative trajectory to deliver much in the way of creepy atmosphere let alone actual scares
Despite sitting through an endless parade of found footage stinkers every so often there's a movie like The Houses October Built that proves that the subgenre is far from dead
Tis the season kids and this is a great Halloween-time tale of absolute terror Revel in it
This is a somewhat tiresome found-footage excursion admirable in how it came together and disappointing that it couldn't have added up to more than it ultimately does
What sets this film appart from other found footage movies is the fact that it tries to be a documentary at times adding more credibility to what we see on screen Full review in Spanish
Slightly edgy Christmas special makes Santa a grump
it's a clever funny hour that's written in rhyme with imaginative songs threaded throughout
It's way short on charm labors to be amusing and runs out of gas well before its hour is up
The very multicultural Murray is one of those rare holiday specials the entire family can enjoy for years to come
But at the risk of sounding like a Grinch while Murray gets the sleigh off the ground How Murray Saved Christmas doesn't manage to stay airborne
It's the kind of special that harried parents may want to turn on for their own tired parents to help babysit the kids They'll enjoy the extended tribute to milkmen
This really is how Groundhog Day would go if Bill Murray was a high schooler
The dim comedy Premature owes a debt to the looping time structure of Groundhog Day but it owes more to those inglorious sex teases of the 's when wet dreams became waking nightmares
While it's fun to imagine what John Waters might have done with that in the s Beers and Harawitz run dry so to speak very quickly forcing them to return to their stockpile of mirthless lowbrow gags
Mr Beers and his fellow screenwriter Mathew Harawitz also have a numbing Seth MacFarlane-esque weakness for purely attention-getting crudeness and unfunny stereotypes
A modest but likeable spin on Groundhog Day
Premature hits all the bases but doesn't knock it out of the park
Beers' giddy feature embraces the sophomoric tradition of Porky's-era horny male humor with a warm consistently funny attitude like a scrappier version of American Pie
It's not overbearing nor is it explosively good
Even with all its shortcomings that there's a film out there that uses masturbation as a time travel device is something to celebrate
So now we're stuck with a main character we know is an unrepentant sex offender basically Dumb
Only undiscriminating audiences with a pronounced taste for crotch-centric tomfoolery will sample this goulash
A retread of every lousy 's high school comedy you never bothered watching
The result isn't very inspired as it clumsily mixes sophomoric gags with a more genuine satire of high-school social life with the obligatory teachers who are dumber than the kids
I remember laughing but I don't remember why It's a little like being stuck in time
The rare teen comedy with serious raunch and heart Premature is much much better than any movie about ejaculation-triggered time travel has any right to be
A rapidly wearying comedy that mistakes crudeness with humor
Premature is all of the embarrassing humiliation people who didn't lose their virginity fast enough felt and experienced throughout their entire lives packed into an hour and a half
It's a bizarre and surprisingly clever concept that really makes the most of it for a lot of laughs
Yes it's predictably crude and juvenile but in between the bodily secretion gags there's dialogue and performances that are genuinely funny
Imperfect yet energetic and complete with big laughs and heart if you're nostalgic for the American Pie flicks Premature will do the trick
a seemingly electrifying premise that's utilized to hopelessly uninvolving and consistently dull effect
Antonio de la Torre is brilliant as a killer and eater of young women in Manuel Martin Cuenca's sumptuously lensed psychological drama
Cuenca's mixture of beauty and grotesquerie brings enough edginess to Carlos' murderous and loving ways
It keeps us at a remove that becomes telling of the filmmaker's reticence to explore whatever feelings of isolation and yearning may inform his main character's grisly compulsion
The film ultimately fails to work except as an aesthetic exercise
Knowing as little about Carlos as we do makes for a film that frustrates
In the end Cannibal stays too far away from the depravity at its center to the point where Tailor might have been the more appropriate title
A meticulous lead performance by Antonio de la Torre is the one saving grace of this dumb arty horror movie from Spain
Unhurried in its pacing exquisitely photographed and very sparing in its presentation of bloodshed and violence Cannibal observes but does not comment
No this cannibal we do not root for -- although eventually we might feel pity
An old-fashioned appealingly sentimental drama about homefront life during WWII
A heartfelt personal film with great performances aims for the stars and falls back to earth
The period details are so lovingly burnished in this uneven if heartfelt feature that for a while they threaten to overpower the story which delves gently into a rarely explored aspect of the war
Writer and co-director Kate Connor's debut feature Fort McCoy is an example of what happens when you try to shoehorn as many topics and themes from WWII as you can into one movie
Fort McCoy is an obvious labor of love That doesn't make it a good movie but it's a nice sentiment all the same
If the film has a major flaw it's the profusion of subplots in a -minute running time Still it is a real accomplishment
The picture doesn't quite add up to anything in the end but parts work as intended with Wiig's subtle performance a great asset to director Liza Johnson
This jumbled drama gets decent mileage out of actress Kristen Wiig but is hindered by a subpar script that fails to translate Munro's characterizations and intricate plotting to the screen
The people on screen are all worth watching as is Johnson's directorial career
Rather than sifting through the emotional layers of a surprisingly determined young woman more often the scenes feel drained of life
Kristen Wiig's performance in Hateship Loveship is so beautifully muted it takes a while to appreciate the loveliness of the notes she's hitting
The buttoned-up buttoned-lipped Wiig seems to have landed in the Midwest from Mars as though like David Bowie before her she's The Maid Who Fell to Earth
Slow-moving drama has some sex drinking language
Short fiction can be a marvelous blueprint for film and revisiting Nobel Prize-winner Munro's story in this era of catfishing makes a lot of sense People are no less desperate for connection than they ever have been
We've never seen a protagonist quite like Johanna who on the one hand personifies female self-abnegation at its most domesticated but on the other embodies the sheer will at its most stubborn
Liza Johnson's nicely tuned and turned adaptation of the Alice Munro short story Hateship Friendship Courtship Loveship Marriage
Another of the wan so-called 'indie' films that distributors accumulate at what must be some sort of post-Sundance clearance sale
Kristen Wiig delivers a splendid dramatic performance here She simply becomes a plain unobtrusive woman with immense inner strength
It doesn't take long for us to get lost in Wiig's thorough portrayal of a dowdy housekeeper who must soldier on in the face of a cruel prank to find some kind of love in her life
Wiig's underplaying a repressed otherworldly Sissy Spacek sort of thing has its moments of humor but this proud simple woman is never for an instant comic
A slow-to-develop but nonetheless tantalizing sampling of the depth of Kristen Wiig's talent one that hints at what may to come from her
My problem is I never believed what was happening was love
Punchless drama stars a serious Wiig
a remarkably delicate portrait of a shy recessive but ultimately unsinkable woman entirely free of self-pity that confirms the remarkable watchability of Kristen Wiig
Director Liza Johnston elicits some very affecting performances from her talented actors but these are in service to Wiig's rather colorless character whose blossoming is a bit hard to fall for
Hateship Loveship is by no means a bad film but it's an unfortunately easy one
Unfortunately schmaltzy music and drab melodrama drag down the otherwise graceful moves of Five Dances
Though the film's untested cast struggles with the drama and the sketched-out story is often banal there are several amateurish calls-to-mom scenes the presentation of a specific city subculture is etched from the heart
It's the moments when the director stops worrying about clarifying plot and character motivation and lets the performances bring those into being that makes this an authentic project
There's an interesting vibe there but it's not enough to save what seems like a failed experiment
Just when the plotting had me sighing with impatience Brown would get back into showing us rehearsal and things would liven up again It's in the recording of dance that this movie comes alive
Anyone not associated with the world of modern dance andor anyone not fixated on the bodies of agile young men will find little of interest in this slow claustrophobic film
Rather than adapting the pieces to conform to his paper-thin narrative Brown explores the tensions and contortions of dancers expressing fresh emotion through a pre-existing art form
Five Dances should well impress dance aficionados even if its skimpy narrative proves less than inspired
A lovingly shot valentine to work and body and art and a generous ultimately happy little story of a lost boy finding a community and a kindred soul
At times the plot seems to exist merely to string together all these dance scenes  Unfortunately Five Dances feels more interested in the art than the artist
Andresevic includes photogenic clips of the vibrant and diverse areas of New York City giving a strong sense of the settings of the different love stories spread around the city
A cautiously optimistic doc that explores the relationships of eight New Yorkers
While Love Etc shows restraint in its broad look at the universal desire for companionship it remains a frustratingly thin affair
VIDEO Jill Andresevic's hokey-but-enjoyable brief documentary study of romantic relationships is set in New York's five boroughs
That relationships are like hard isn't exactly a revelatory thesis and most of Andresevic's subjects seem too conscious of the camera -- and prone to post-reality TV empty confession -- to reveal anything beyond the obvious
It's about as deep as an afternoon of people-watching
Love Etc's cross-section of New Yorkers simply isn't as captivating as its cross-section of New York particularly the Queens and Brooklyn neighborhoods that rarely grace the screen
TV reality show-style doc offers superficial portraits of amour
Tedious portraits and flat observations about love by couples and singles in New York City
Who needs clichd Hollywood love stories when you can see the real thing
Breakups and disappearances loneliness and failing health fit into the film's fabric like beats in a TV drama
How do you find love in a teeming city of  million souls This lightweight likable documentary attempts to answer that question
Avoids cloying clichs through the bittersweet lessons each learns to show I love you can be richer more nuanced and more expansive than Hollywood fairy tales
Throw a party and ask all your friends to share their stories you'll probably find more surprises and have a lot more fun
Each of the six protagonists in Love Etc are sweet and hopeful in a genuinely human way that fictional films simply cannot touch
A particularly poignant examination of love which magically ushers the audience right into the middle of the romantic relationships of a variety of native New Yorkers
A good first date documentary
It's not that you don't care for these urbanites -- you do but it's in spite of Andresevic's unengaged hanging-around and general air of slightness
Jill Andresevic's simply photographed documentary springs from an equally simple premise
In an age in which it feels as if seemingly pure intimacy no longer exists this film thrives on nothing but intimate moments
Alice Eve gives a smooth performance and one of the few reasons to last through to the very end even after a moment that all but invites you to bail
Doesn't reinvent man-vs-woman theater but it's a twisty and vitriolic barb-fest that should please audiences in the mood for respite from holiday cheer
Well worth watching and arguing over
Anyone game to watch two effortlessly volatile and vulnerable performers trade barbs for  minutes ought to give this due consideration
This smallest of films marks a welcome return to the world of interpersonal miniature for the writer-director I hope he stays here a while
I came away from this malevolent exercise with the sense that these two add up to little more than the sum of their awfulness
A sad example of what sometimes happens when a writer of gripping stage plays controls his own independent movie to his own selfish labored self-satisfaction
You'll want to watch the film again immediately and it will rattle around in your head for hours If not longer
Though LaBute wrote this for the screen I mistakenly decided that it must have originated onstage because the oblique heavily freighted dialogue seems too elegant and artful for a medium dominated by hacks
With Some Velvet Morning LaBute returns to the provocative style that made his name
Fine acting aside this is a story that should have remained untold
a massive disappointment
One revelation leads to another as well as the expected sexual confrontation but then there's a moment of gentility of grown-up understanding and even well tenderness of a weird order Desire love It's all transactional
There is that horrible climax and then the ridiculous twist that makes you go oh this was an even bigger waste of time than I already thought it was
This clich ridden film is a staggering disappointment a morally offensive done-on-the-cheap movie with a lifeless single location
It's a tantalising walk on the dark side and LaBute is the ultimate manipulator I was enthralled repulsed and intrigued often feeling like a voyeur peering into a labyrinth of intimacies
Stanley Tucci and Alice Eve waste their time and ours in a dreadful boring two-hander about a man who leaves his wife for his much younger mistress
The look of Some Velvet Morning remains clean and flat the decor is mostly hotel-room neutral The major visual idea is to have Eve's red dress and lipstick stand out against a monochromatic backdrop effective in itself but not enough
Some Velvet Morning is at best a missed opportunity and mercifully a short one
Some might view the end as a cruel prank at the expense of moviegoers while others might consider it a cop-out but perhaps the point of it all is that we should not rush to judgment when it comes to Mr LaBute's theater of cruelty
'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is not the old James Thurber short story brought to the big screen It's important to make that clear
The cinematography is exceptional - if only the acting and script were on that level
The remake is straightforward with fewer secrets more sentiment and it isn't as funny
Walter Mitty has a big heart and I like it for that But this is definitely a case where a little simpler would have been a lot better overall
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a disappointment an often confusing and silly contrivance of an unbecoming-of-age comedy based on Thurber's literary work adapted into a  vehicle for star Danny Kaye
Inspiring seize-the-day tale with some peril and flirting
This is one of the more disappointing efforts of the holiday movie season
a superior comedydrama that's often much more profound than its marketing materials may have indicated
Of course Stiller takes many liberties with Thurber's old chestnut but there is a sense that its theme of yearning really means something to him
It still has a good amount of heart to it particularly from the delightful Wiig who somehow manages to create an interesting and empathetic character out of thin material
A charmer with a good heart and a healthy dose of unrealism
Big budget films that are actually about something are so rare this one's worth checking out just for novelty value alone
Mitty doodles and dawdles through the world swept away by momentary bursts of special-effects fantasy while his life is changed by the presence of a cake made by his mother
Somehow out of a no-win situation Stiller manages to make a likable movie that entertains and also provides a little get-out-of-the-basement inspiration
A good-natured bit of escapist fluff that relies a bit too much on whiz-bang special effects
Ignore the liberties the film takes with the original something the  Danny Kaye movie also did much to Thurber's annoyance and this version proves to be a briskly entertaining glossily photographed globe-trotting romp
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is one charming film to see and there's nothing wrong with a feel-good movie that makes you feel good about liking it
Steve Conrad's script is a jumbled farce misfiring on comedic executions and inserting beats that have no real relevance to the story
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty provides fun and laughs but also meaningful thoughts on life and how we choose to live it along with a touching lead performance you'll want to root for
While the original Mitty was a heartbreakingly sad figure this Mitty is a weak parable for living life to the fullest or something like that
Improves on its predecessor by being effectively plotless
Some of these routines are hilarious others forced but they're all routines not parts of a cohesive work
A tedious exercise in self-consciously hip lowbrow comedy
Dumb is a word you use as a kid but it's the only way to describe Quentin Dupieux's latest WRONG COPS
For the rightwrong sensibility there's reason to enjoy the filmmaker's weird attempts at stripping the ordinary from the everyday
Pitched somewhere between a DIY alt-humor video and a knockabout comedy this meandering lark about a corrupt spiteful and hopelessly distracted police force in a decriminalized sun-scorched city never quite finds the funny bone
Doesn't have structure but there are laughs especially for viewers on the prowl for weird stuff from a helmer who's become quite skilled at concocting ludicrousness
No doubt a labor of love the result is just plain laborious for the audience
It's tonally weird and totally forgettable
If you are tired of mainstream movies why not give this a chance
What's more Flowers in the Attic feels like a genuine nod of appreciation for the original book and Andrews' characters and it's well worth a look for fans who appreciated the series
This tale of a twisted family's misguided quest for love and money is still creepy and atmospheric enough to make for pulpy television fun
Despite some retro fun at the beginning which suggests the movie is going to be just as stilted and poorly written as we expect there's no fun once we make it to the Foxworths
Flowers in the Attic acts as if it is just another life-affirming Lifetime movie about surviving terrible situations
Though the five-book Dollanganger series eventually descends into straight-faced plot-pretzels the likes of which will probably show up on The Spoils Of Babylon much of the Gothic drama in this installment is quaint by cable standards
The only way to review Flowers in the Attic is to consider how well it does what it sets out to do that is adapt the book faithfully and still make an entertaining film For that it gets a B
It all seems fairly preposterous until one takes into account that stranger things have happened in real life
The last thing you want to do is play it straight Unfortunately that's the only way Lifetime knows how to play it
All the actors are spot-on even ones who have just a few scenes
Lifetime goes there then backs away from the issue immediately making for some scenes that add nothing to the story but brief bouts of nausea
Escape can't come too soon
The problem is it always sounds like it's more fun or at least more kooky than it actually plays onscreen
I was particularly delighted when the children figured out that their mother was trying to kill them with powdered rat poison sprinkled on donuts but this should all be a lot more frightening - or at least more unsettling - than it winds up being
It was adapted into a middling creepy film in  Now Lifetime has remade it as a sharper creepy TV movie
The problem is not that it's just terrible but that it's also no fun At all
's pulp novel gets creepy with evil adults incest
VC Andrews' popular and creepy  novel Flowers in the Attic gets no favors from the scriptwriters in this latest adaptation
The production moves at a brisk pace and unlike the children's predicament never feels claustrophobic
Frankly the best Lifetime movies straddle that fine line between totally engaging look at serious issues and overacted campy mess very well and FitA just didn't cut it It was  kinda boring right
All four films in this series based on the VC Andrews novels are among the dozens of offerings featured in the  holiday gift guide at ReelBobcom
Snakes in the Pulpit
Director Mitchell Altieri helms the thriller with a sure hand
Long before its feeble drawn-out ending it's clear no miracle can cure this film's many frailties
Utterly suspense-less noxious missing-person would-be thriller overflowing with tired clichs and off-putting revelations
The horror-oriented turns one might expect from these filmmakers never really arrive and the eventual plot revelations feel a bit undercooked even for a straight thriller
Manages to touch on some compelling points before committing to its familiar but satisfying finale
sets its heroine's personal dramas against the spiralling symptomatology of her infection fusing psychological insights with full-on body horror leading towards an ending that is also a new beginning in this young woman's metamorphosis
Ultimately disappointing due to an inane script which fashions a thoroughly unlikable idiotic protagonist who invites derision more than sympathy
Icky and violent and shocking but Contracted is also smart insightful and sort of tragic
England supplies a sly very cool denouement that suggests his intention was to craft a smart take on the most popular horror sub-genre at present
A body-horror opus that will satisfy genre fans who like to be grossed out but doesn't have much to offer on any other count
Contracted does for sex what Jaws did for beaches let's just leave it at that
There's no payoff to the paranoia
It's hard to make out what if anything writer-director Eric England is trying to say about the fragility of the flesh with Contracted which amounts to little more than a slow-motion replay of The Fly's central gross-out
Contracted can best be described as Contagion meets Blue Is the Warmest Color without all those explicit sex scenes
The ending to this fable misses the opportunity for broader metaphorical resonance but getting there has its own unnerving rewards
Contracted goes all-out on the gross-out
None of it feels remotely believable but also isn't broadly defined enough to be satire falling in that dull gap in the middle
By being the directorwriter and co-producer England the writer didn't have an independent director to say Hey the ending needs to be stronger or What's the movie saying about lesbians having sex with men
Our inability to identify with Townshend means we can't identify with the film's central horror and thus Contracted isn't all that unsettling
Contracted is an efficiently icky gross-out exercise in body horror that should please fans of this kind of thing Still the lack of any substance below the surface is ultimately too frustrating to ignore
A very adult and straight faced glimpse at an ugly human being rotting from the inside out
Instead of giving the viewer the satisfaction of watching a movie this charming collection of incidents feels like flipping through a magazine with amusing Franglais quotations pulled
You never learn why exactly she deserves a feature-length portrait Maybe people will get sick of me Roitfeld muses A little more than  minutes should do the trick
Mademoiselle C succeeds in showcasing the rarified entity that is Carine Roitfeldbut it's ultimately more of a fawning love letter than a nuanced profile of a woman who surely must be more fascinating than she comes off here
It's to Carine Roitfeld's own credit and director Fabien Constant's funky and frenetic pacing that the doc feels neither like a corporate hagiography nor like mere fashionista masturbation material
Roitfeld seems constantly inspired by the prospect of pushing boundaries and expectations and that in turn is inspiring to watch
As vanity projects go this one's unusually well-made - as any portrait of an iconic stylist ought to be
Fabien Constant's doc about ultimate fashionista Carine Roitfeld will be catnip to the style-obsessed while definitely showing that a lot of hard work goes into those all glossy images one carelessly flips through
As a distinctly not-insider  I would have benefited more from a broader portrait of the woman herself and how she became such a legend
Fantastic access if minimal drama
High in gloss if not necessary insight this is manna for fashion fans but a marginally slighter piece of work than The September Issue
For fashion junkies Mademoiselle C will be like five September issues of Vogue all rolled into one
It's a film which treats its audience like beggars wallowing in the gutter
Unfortunately the film doesn't show its subject's creative process as much as that of her collaborators
A lively but exasperatingly incurious and obsequious work about Carine Roitfeld the former Vogue Paris editor-in-chief who quit the Cond Nast empire in  to start her own publication called CR Fashion Book
There are just so many ways Carine Roitfeld can say she loves fashion in Mademoiselle C a somewhat interesting documentary that brings us into the inner workings of a magazine but harps a bit too much on her ideas of fashion and style
hard to follow relatively incoherentshe is shown as a peripatetic presence with seeming indefatigable energy But she talks so much during the first hour that it becomes enormously annoying
Grace Unplugged may be a film that only a Christian could love but there seemed to be plenty of Christians loving on it in the audience
Feels like a religious tract more than a movie
Tepid and predictable
It should satisfy its intended audience and maybe even bring a few new viewers into the flock
Don't suspect any surprises It is a Christian film and demonstrates melodramatic TV strategies Still on its own terms it is entertaining
Slick sophisticated but bland with that faith-based film curse of having little humor and no edge at all
A movie with a moral lesson about what is to be valued is effective without being preachy
Predictable prodigal daughter tale with Christian message
A creative and compelling documentary about Simone Weil a French philosopher activist and mystic whom writer Albert Camus called the only great spirit of our time
Ultimately the film doesn't feel like it ever left Julia Haslett's head leaving us a little cold
Julia Haslett's absorbing if patchy ode to Weil an advocate for the rights of the disadvantaged confronts her subject's ideas of moral responsibility through surprisingly personal and experimental means
Though Weil remains fascinating Ms Haslett's film even when it uses more traditional documentary techniques mostly isn't
Honorable but self-indulgent attempt to bring alive the elusive French philosopher-activist-leftist Simone Weil meshed this with the filmmaker's personal family history
Filmmaker Julia Haslett was so moved by a quote of Simone Weil's that she spent the next six years studying the French philosopher and making a film about her life and writings
Just hearing brilliant actors like Richard Jenkins and Catherine O'Hara at each other's throats or watching remarkably likable stars like Adam Scott and Mary Elizabeth Winstead figure out their relationship has enough charm
Not only is the movie just so-so but the parts themselves aren't much
ACOD may leave a slightly sour aftertaste As a look at the state of modern monogamy - or at least our enduring if misguided faith in it - it's refreshingly acerbic
There are a few moments of painful insight here that some may find uncomfortable but the script by Modern Family writer Ben Karlin strives to keep things lighthearted It makes for an uneven experience but also an enjoyable one
The film is too broad to be discerning but there are a few laughs here and there thanks to a solid comedic ensemble
It feels like an act of therapy rather than an organic story Fortunately the strong cast of comedy experts make it very funny
I really wanted to like this film because its cast is generally terrific in everything they do  but only Richard Jenkins and Catherine O'Hara really stand out here A near-miss and sadly blah comedy that should have been smarter
Hums along nicely as it diagnoses what Dr Judith calls 'the least-parented least-nurtured generationever' It's funny without being broad thanks to a fine ensemble
Promising premise goes nowhere
It's more a situation than a story but a pretty funny situation
NO
Has a few moments that shine but the rest is shockingly leaden and clumsy feeling around for a heart it hasn't earned and for laughs that seldom arrive
The tone is irresolute as if Zicherman a self-proclaimed ACOD hadn't fully resolved his feelings before spinning them into this lumpy comedic drama
Watching Jenkins and O'Hara go at it in more ways than one is especially terrific fun
It's often very funny and tries to have some heart too But it doesn't straddle that line all too well
In spite of good intentions ACOD fails to capitalize on its compelling 'Adult Children of Divorce' platform to present viewers with equally captivating insights
a busy movie for one running under  minutes with people like Amy Poehler and Jessica Alba popping in with no-destination characters and poor Mary Elizabeth Winstead wasted in the wings as Carter's patient girlfriend
May be one of the grimmest movies you'll see this year
A decent script is brought to life because of the strong supporting players in this new comedy
Ephemeral as a Snapchat message
The demure self-effacing Struzan undermines Sharkey's strategy by insisting his art is only the product of a mundane creative process
Drew makes a valid case for the artist as not simply an all-time great but as a casualty of a business that prizes bottom-line cost management above unique creativity
There's a context to Struzan -- not just biographically but culturally -- and while Sharkey seems to understand that his movie ironically doesn't illustrate it particularly well
The summary comes when the low-key Struzan offhandedly reveals what he often hears Give it your magic It's all on view here
At length the cheerleading capped with fawning fanboys at San Diego Comic-Con becomes a mildly taxing torrent And Mr Struzan while an agreeable presence is not an especially engrossing speaker
This star-studded documentary about poster artist Drew Struzan would never play as fiction His rags-to-riches journey from poverty to Hollywood acclaim is straight out a 's movie
Though it will play well with genre diehards on video the sometimes awkwardly shot doc is too fawning and narrow in scope to attract much of a crowd in theaters
The Norman Rockwell of movie advertising steps in front of the camera for a long-overdue celebration sure to delight fans and heighten awareness of his legacy
A movie that celebrates the work but at the expense of contemporary John Alvin who isn't just a glaring omission from the story but in a couple of instances is actively obliterated from it
the documentary is also a sly elegy for a changing Hollywood where real hands-on artistry is being replaced by the rush to digital homogeneity
It's a fascinating study of the limits of protest but also a disjointed film each new witness shifts us further away from the central thread into increasingly dry political debate
The staggering landscapes of this mountainous land are captured beautifully as director Dirk Simon picks apart contradictions within Tibetan society Philip Glass Thom Yorke and Damien Rice provide terrific musical accompaniment
A lengthy demanding but worthwhile film  admirably clear-headed about the deep splits within the Tibetan opposition
Much of what people say here is maddeningly phased out in favour of oozingly self-righteous music by Philip Glass precisely what Tibet does not need an arty score
Good access good heart bad craft
An extremely powerful documentary about Tibet's struggle for emancipation from China that's passionate in its plea and highly informative although slightly bloated
A valuable though flawed documentary about the international movement to free Tibet from Chinese rule
You needn't disagree with the film's cause to feel oppressed by its propagandistic approach - not to mention Philip Glass's relentlessly mournful score
Landing between the twee naturalistic and formulaic Sassy Pants settles for cute taking too few gambles to make a more lasting impression
With its positive gay images and even a perfectly executed two-step line dance Sassy Pants is a feel-good movie for girls of both sexes
Sassy Pants has a slightly ludic atmosphere akin to another tale of teen alienation Dear Lemon Lima but it unfolds like a fable in which only Bethany doesn't feel like a canned caricature
Although it attempts a kind of outr pose the film ultimately proves a too-gentle juggling act that never quite soars
Until Sassy Pants loses its nerve and turns somewhat warm and fuzzy Ms Sohn maintains tight control of the story of Bethany's liberation from her domestic prison to pursue fashion
Sweet and well-intentioned Sassy Pants is difficult to dislike despite its missteps
Ignore the gaping plot holes and Now You See Me all comes together in gloriously silly fashion
The idea of magicians conducting a series of heists is a great one but this under-developed film never quite seizes the opportunity Even its terrific A-list cast can't make much of the lame plot
A fairly unmagical couple of hours at the cinema
Now You See Me is a picture that lays all of its cards on the table only to uncover one or two jokers in the pack
Surprisingly delightful audience entertainment unburdened by overzealous special effects and loud soundtrack cues and driven by a story that well just likes the idea of being smart
The story moves jauntily toward its destination the destination unfortunately is a disappointing wreck
Audiences go to magic shows to get fooled but that doesn't mean they want to leave feeling cheated
If you look at the film as escapist fare where you just go 'My brain's off you got a good cast you got a good concept roll with it' -- I think you'll be fine
Now You See Me puts the fun back in being fooled
Hollywood bombast masquerading as something trickier
A hugely enjoyable thriller whose sleight of hand is both audacious and ambitious Louis Leterrier's film is considerable in scale and daring
Seductive with its opening magic show delivering fabulous illusion Now You See Me has a bit of Ocean's  at its heart It's somewhat darker and it's that darkness that gives it texture
Ocean's Eleven for Gen-Y it's a 'pop heist movie' that's more concerned with looking cool than being it
The opening credits roll the stage is set and then SHAZAM all sense of logic magically disappears
Abracadabra The character development has vanished But the flowers are still standing
If you are going to avail yourself to two of hours slight of hand and slippery conjuring you are going to have to be willing to believe the unbelievable to fully enjoy the show
Like a real magic show Now You See Me is thoroughly entertaining for the most part but is ultimately silly and substanceless
This surprisingly witty deliciously well-played and sneakily subversive outing from director Louis Letterier freaks out a little into its final act but nevertheless ranks as one of the year's most entertaining pics
Clever original wildly improbable wildly enjoyable and directed with all the necessary flash and dazzle the film combines the pleasure of a well-engineered heist movie with a twisty-turny plot full of wit double-takes and sleight-of-camera
Now You See Me is a slick crime caper that works because of its witty dialogue  large cast but falls flat due to a finale that fails to leave any sort of magical impression
This compelling modern morality play marking the noteworthy directorial debut of Jon Van Dyke amounts to a searing indictment of India's shameful caste system for its enslavement of females based on the color of their skin
Well-intentioned but slow with no urgency and a lot of preaching
Vitally important theme unstrung by shaky direction writing and acting and a major flaw in subtitling
Writer-director Jon Van Dyke offers rugged production values and his real agenda - getting Christian viewers to help end sex trafficking - mires the movie in self-conscious angst and speeches
Jon Van Dyke's Not Today doesn't qualify as a good movie but it's built on an admirable foundation of good intentions
Touching and Important
So redolent of adolescent fantasy you can practically hear a -year-old shouting Blam
The sheer wastefulness of Eran Creevy's Welcome to the Punch is off-putting enough but the film is also falsely painted-up as a crime epic
Ultimately a case of style over substance and one that its top-notch British ensemble is unable to rescue
Mistakes messiness for complexity while ignoring characterization and real-world politics
Part of the pleasure of watching a movie like Welcome to the Punch is peeling away the multiple layers of inspiration isolating the allusions and figuring out if they're what works or whether the movie earns a little credit
Empty pointless and stupid the barrage of gunfire called Welcome to the Punch is another unappealing entry in the overworked British gangster genre
A super solid action flick Strong and McAvoy are terrific and the film oozes style Fans of Michael Mann or vintage John Woo need to check this out
McAvoy keeps trying to become the Scottish Tom Cruise In action pictures he's more the Scottish Michael J Fox
It becomes something of a disquisition on mortality in spite of itself
Despite its visual polish and fine ensemble this British police drama is strictly by-the-numbers
Angry men mumble as they point guns at each other in a series of standoffs in Welcome to the Punch and it almost works
One straight-faced gunfight after another signifying nothing
Welcome to the Punch is derivative dumb fun
Fast-paced storytelling can't seem to hide Welcome To The Punch's tastelessly cookie-cutter script created using material from every action thriller clich you can rattle off the top of your head
When Max finally gets a chance to ask Jacob why the killer didn't kill him when he had the chance the answer's as unsatisfying as the movie
Thankfully a cast of solid UK actors pick up the slack bringing intensity and behavioral nuance to an otherwise airy actioner that feels severely pared down from its original intent
What really registers in WELCOME TO THE PUNCH is the chase scenes and the high intensity with which it all plays out
Welcome To The Punch should feel a little grander like it's on a bigger scale to match the wide-ranging plot
While it remains mildly entertaining throughout Welcome to the Punch lacks the snap crackle and pop of other contemporary examples of the genre
Welcome to the Punch is a crowd-pleaser with a minimalistic attitude
The interesting premise is undermined at every turn by idiotic characters and overwhelming contrivance
a tense siege thriller that uses its genre trappings to expose a blighted beleaguered underclass of the here and now Tower Block however is eventually undone by its own gravity coming back down to ground level with a decidedly tepid ending
The action and anxiety are believable the violence sudden and the performances - especially those of Sheridan Smith as an East End Sarah Connor and Jack O'Connell as a thug-come-good - are strong
An unusual scuzzy setting for a thriller that delivers with brutal simplicity
Entertaining well written thriller enlivened by strong performances from a superb cast and a decent amount of shocks though it's slightly let down by a disappointing finale
There are plenty of clichs like lifts that don't work and a mysteriously disappearing phone signal It's badly lit and rather grim with far too many extreme close-ups
Guilty pleasure is pushing it but you might develop a certain guilty appreciation for the way this slab of breezeblock Brit-schlock goes about its ludicrously contrived business
It's not a bad idea for a movie but what we get is undercooked with poor logic and even poorer pacing conspiring to prevent any much-needed tension to build
Tower Block doesn't rise high enough to match its ambitions
The ending is a letdown but this is still a very promising debut from directors James Nunn and Ronnie Thompson
The film is efficiently made and more realist than some of its ilk in that the desperate inhabitants seem credible What it lacks is directorial flair
Contains some effective jolts and engaging characters But after setting up the premise it doesn't really have anywhere to go Kind of like the characters themselves
Gritty and claustrophobic this British horror-thriller holds our interest with well-played characters rather than the wobbly plotting
Thanks to the muddled plot motivations Tower Block really struggles in the final third
It is an expertly crafted thriller with a mastery of tension-building techniques
Though suspension of disbelief is a pre-requisite this is a rather gripping thriller
Conde knows that being in New York has given him the opportunity to make a life but Govenar's slow pace doesn't quite do the story justice
In a film plunked somewhat unfortunately between the inspirational and the ordinary the impressively patient Mr Conde voices public-service-announcement sentiments about being able to do as much as anyone else
Loving truly inspirational documentary which captures the lion-sized spirit of a very special artist
A great story about a great man and a reminder of why NYC remains one of the world's thriving metropolises Hint it makes it possible for someone like the film's subject to make a life for himself
This portrait of an indomitable figure overcoming his handicap proves deeply inspirational
Despite its title there's actually very little dancing or rhythmic flair in You Don't Need Feet to Dance
An inspiring documentary about a disabled West African drummer whose music and dancing enable him to transcend his woes and rejoice in the gift of life
Underwhelming and undernourishing
Grint is great though it does peter out a little in the final reel
Naess makes heavy weather of a hoary old theme
Although nicely produced this second world war yarn is bland and predictable
This is clearly breaking no new ground But it does what it does with some skill and likeability
Their little world in the wooden hut they find eventually becomes a microcosm of the real one where they can leave behind some of the sillier prejudices of war
Ponderous pacing makes this true-life tale a lot less enthralling than it might have been
The performances are more than adequate
The cast acquit themselves well forging convincing and ultimately moving relationships as they learn how little petty political differences mean when starvation's at the door
Generates a satisfactory amount of suspense and personality to achieve its limited goals successfully spinning routine with welcome attention to character
As dramatically potent as a B-tier Disney drama Into the White while displaying instances of complexity is mired by clich and melodrama
Much glossier more bright-lights-big-city and less jolting than the gritty  original
If we haven't caught on from earlier films that drug pushing is a thankless persuasion maybe this is the movie that will pound in the lesson
Prieto's remake capably mimics the original's breakneck energy without adding a single thing
it feels like just another movie about crime and drugs as Frank's week goes from bad to worse
A remake of a  Danish thriller it's a pulsating propulsive and nerve-racking film that breathes new life into a genre whose tropes wore out long ago
There's an ugly jittery beauty to Pusher a very fine British redo of a  Danish movie of the same title
The remake undercuts most everything that made the original distinctive its tangy pungent sense of low-lifes and their environment swept away for a glam stylized world
Pusher is some kind of tragedy though not the one its filmmakers intended
We're  left to cheer someone simply because there's really no one else to root for
Prieto does what he can to keep things roaring along but the overall effect is not a lot more stimulating than your average diet cola
The chief problem here is that Frank is neither likable nor very bright For the most part you're thinking go ahead bust his kneecaps
a perfectly serviceable race-against-the-clock thriller thanks to a powerful lead performance from Richard Coyle
Pusher is unnecessary for Refn fans that have followed his work from the beginning but is more worthwhile for new viewers since they don't know what they're in for
Both the theme and the execution are formulaic although Spanish director Luis Prieto shows some visual flair
The most original British gangster flick in years
Pusher has a neon-lit nervy energy -- at once slick and grungy -- and the sort of unabashed screw-tightening rhythms that genre enthusiasts will embrace
Prieto treats the experience like a music video with superfluous visual ornamentation getting in the way of gritty suspense Pusher is a sound and light show that should have its power strip unplugged
The characters that populate Pusher are surprisingly nave and hardly the brightest of bulbs So much for the image of the wily street-smart criminal
Just stick to the original Fate is always more fetching than formula
Sniffing into the seams of England's multiculti capital it's best at showing the grungy hustling-and-bustling city as a place of slowly uncoiling despair A hyper-charged buzzy take on the London night-scene-and one man slipping under it for no-good
A decently acted coming-of-age drama that scores points for its setting -- a Canadian Indian reservation high school
Doron has assembled a uniformly solid cast starting with an impressive debut by Evans whose brown eyes are both soulful and watchful It's a performance that commands our attention and empathy
Part of the long march of misunderstood movie adolescents that leads from the frozen Canadian North straight down to James Dean's Los Angeles in Rebel Without a Cause
It's an undeniably noble effort from all involved but the dreary denouement makes viewer feel lesser than blessed
Despite the movie's issues Doron has no trouble capturing the haunting grace of place and people and the harsh realities faced by The Lesser Blessed
The emotions present in Anita Doron's film still feel fresh and universal even if some of the dialogue is clunky
Unlike his father Gotham Chopra is more interested in his own latent daddy issues than with questions of cosmic import
As much an exercise in self-help as it is a demystification of its title character
A documentary following Deepak Chopra a fireball of energy creativity and spiritual vision on the road for a year filmed by his son
Like its subject the movie is not as calculating as it seems
Glossy tribute from a son to his eminent guru of a papa is not so different even with all that spirituality from recent film portraits of Katy Perry and Justin Bieber
While Decoding offers some tantalizing insights into the celebrity guru the movie at its core is playing out daddy issues as the filmmaker wonders aloud about whether his dad has gotten too big for his britches
Decoding ultimately becomes Gotham's gentle tribute to Dad who shall probably provide handsomely for his heirs It is also a tacit endorsement of Chopra Inc
There is precious little table-turning or real insight in Decoding Deepak - unless uncovering a passion for Starbucks and a preference for upscale hotels counts as takedown material
Gotham spent a lifetime observing his father connect with the faithful and he's skeptical of the wise teachereager student dynamic
Tthe film feels amateurish and leaves a lot to be desired as a documentary on one of the world's biggest spiritual icons
The virtue of this standard family tale is James Gandolfini's most substantial feature role to date
Down the Shore suggests what might happen if TBS and Bruce Springsteen were to collaborate on a sitcom set in hell
Any moments of honesty are immediately drowned out by a blast of heartfelt tunes that assure you the scene you've been watching was significant
Brando-wheezing Gandolfini never slums it but there's still no shaking the sense that a pro has shown up for amateur hour
Costa brings a nice lived-in sexiness to the evocatively shot setting and Gandolfini settles into his character with extraordinary skill and sensitivity
Gandolfini and Janssen dance a delicate minuet around one another pacing out a slow quiet revelation of the shared past that has paralyzed their wills to happiness and change
None of it hangs together - particularly as the film heads into his final third and you realize director Harold Guskin and screenwriter Sandra Jennings don't have a clue as to how to wrap things up
The director Harold Guskin and writer Sandra Jennings show admirable patience in letting the story unspool and the actors reward them
A small-scale working-class character study that's never quite as nuanced and dramatic as it aspires to be
In terms of pace Down the Shore walks a very narrow line between deliberate and utterly languid but there are just enough strong performances and intriguing if messy dynamics to make it work
Most entertainment is gained from watching Mature going through the painful process of emoting which is rather like watching an overlarge ham hock attempt to break out into a broad grin
If you'll settle for gold-plated pageants for muscular episodes and for graphic inducements to wolf-whistling then Samson and Delilah is for you
Wonderfully chintzy and hokey Bible epic once described as the only film in which the hero had bigger tits than the heroine
Was once best described by the film critic Dilys Powell as the only epic film in which the hero had bigger tits than the heroine
Cecil B DeMille has again dipped into the Bible for his material made appropriately dramatic revisions in the original and turned up with a DeMille-size smash
Lavishly produced this Oscar nominated epic is a good example of DeMille's type of spectacles
Here DeMille the master of the crowd scene is in top form managing thousands of extras particularly in the savage battle scenes in which Samson destroys the Philistine army with the jawbone of an ass
The film cannot avoid the broad contours of Samson's story of course but it does tweak things in ways that make Samson look a little more heroic
Feels like the unkempt offspring of Lock Up Mad Max and The Cannonball Run Only not as good as those movies
Ask it no questions and it will tell you no lies a fair bargain that too many other films on this level resolutely refuse to grant
there's plenty of action - and plenty of boobs
Death Race  Inferno is like a monster truck rally People go to see mayhem And people who like the Death Race movies are also watching to see the stunts They don't expect a good story Thank goodness
Inferno absolutely pulls ahead of Death Race  as far as the Death Race franchise is concerned but that's not hard when your competition comes in at an uncontested dead last
Watching Death Race  Inferno is a lot like a casual viewer taking in the Indianapolis  Watching the cars go around is ok but what puts butts in seats is the threat of wanton destruction and there's plenty of it here
In Our Nature is as prophetic as it is provocative exploring dysfunction in a recognizable but no less satisfying way
Savelson's approach feels old-fashioned and perhaps even a little stodgy
Like Carnage it gets off to a rocky start in keeping all its protagonists from leaving the movie But if you can make it past that - and John Slattery helps a bunch - Brian Savelson's film settles into a nicely mature story about airing grievances
Yes the pacing of In Our Nature is slow and drags near the film's halfway point but the top-notch ensemble propels the film forward adding complexity to the characters while leaving the over-the-top melodrama for Lifetime
A drama filled with the same kind of emotional fireworks that animate the gripping familial interactions in works by Arthur Miller and Eugene O'Neill
Savelson can't seem to mount a head of steam and his chamber piece feels underdeveloped
During their getting to know you scene Seth asks Vicky Is everybody that predictable As far as In Our Nature goes it would seem so
In Our Nature lumbers a lot especially early on as Savelson introduces the cast and has Gilford and Slattery keep coming up with weak excuses to stall the movie's premise from kicking in
Beautifully observed characterizations and fine performances enliven this sometimes static drama about an unexpected family reunion
Brian Savelson generally eschews emotional fireworks to create this small and intimate study of how difficult it is to repair broken relationships while trying to preserve those that look promising
This could be renamed Mope-Faced Kingdom
The confessions and conflicts that bubble up feel real and lived if overly familiar to connoisseurs of that dreaded genre known as the dysfunctional-family drama
In Our Nature's visual style seems plastered on or allocated not developed with any sort of authorial singularity
Plays distressingly like a photographed off-Broadway drama
The movie earns high grades for allowing four strong actors to work their way through some basic but interesting obstacles that must of us can relate to in one way or another
horrible
The characters in this family drama are not given enough backstory or nuance to make their problems feel real and none of the characters warrants much interest or compassion
It's like an average weekend nice enough but tepid
A movie that feels like a documentary at times a cheesy docudrama at others and some kind of slapped-together film that wants to be taken seriously as well
Not great not terrible -- just your standard-issue TV movie about a well-known historic event
Seal Team  could only rate as propaganda in a toxic Fox News-driven political environment such as obtains at this moment
If you want a proficient dramatized re-enactment of the May  -   mission to kill Osama bin Laden Seal Team Six meets the bill
In the end it's really just schlocky television fare like Act of Valor
Demonstrates with its narrative lassitude and overall dullness just how much Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal did right
Everyone seems to be sleepwalking through their parts in this picture
Like the baseball diamond that features so prominently in his film we all know which base will be dutifully tapped next and that a home-run for the characters is inevitable
A badly overwritten script reduces what might be an intriguing exploration of aging into a trite inspirational drama
As for Adams and Timberlake they clearly signed on for the chance to work with a genuine screen legend -- wouldn't you given the chance
The star power helps the charm outweigh the schmaltz
By the end as hokey as this might seem I found myself getting caught up it in emotionally and overall it somehow manages to work
From Clint Eastwood's lovable old coot persona to Amy Adams' iron-willed combativeness this film is a stunning beautiful surprise A sports movie a romance without sentimentality and the emotional trauma of a family secret
As much as I loved Clint's squinty-eyed punditry at the RNC his latest pitch for a mitt is - to quote Bob Uecker - just a bit outside
It does so much wrong and it is so proud of itself for it But it's too much fun watching these actors have such fun
John Goodman weighs in with a nice cameo as Clint's old boss but the rest is strictly relegation form
The film doesn't ask you to do anything it tells you what to feel when to feel it and lets you know that everything will play out just as expected so that you won't get startled
Lacking narrative momentum saddled with thin characterizations and uninspired plotting Trouble With The Curve should've stayed on the bench
The baseball motifs here serve a more corny story and predictable plot
It is a funny world in which everyone always witlessly says what they mean every life episode is dubiously calculated for your favorite character's benefit and every incompetent person is also morally repellent and physically grotesque
You'd have to be a meanie to let Curve's deficits overwhelm its many charms The story is touching funny when it needs to be and might even leave you a little sad to see the baseball season end
Eastwood manages to maintain his decorum throughout like some veteran pitcher who's lost the speed off his fastball and relies on a sneaky change-up He does just a few things but he does them remarkably well
The good news is that Eastwood does his thing to perfection Adams provides the spunky cuteness and Timberlake couldn't scrub his eager charm off with a Brillo pad if he tried
Long stretches of Trouble With the Curve make you wish you had other ways to occupy yourself
For all its occasional tin ear Dr Phil dialogue its contrivances and shortcuts this remains a fundamentally sound and solid entertainment with a deep-rooted conviction that how we treat each other matters
Doesn't just remind you what a great screen presence Clint Eastwood is it makes you appreciate him even more as a director because Lorenz does such a terrible job
Bigfoot The Lost Coast Tapes is a decent time-waster
Bigfoot wanders straight into every tired trope and trap of the conceit
The long and inglorious list of Bigfoot movies just got longer and more inglorious
This found-footage horror film about the search for Sasquatch is the latest tired entry in an overworked genre
A chilling unnerving and psychologically horrifying experience
Seen it before Sure you have And this horror flick has exactly nothing new to say or add to that threadbare horror clich
Though Demy's approach breaks no new ground directorially speaking Martin's personal journey finds a fresh angle on a universal piece of wisdom
The primary appeal of Americano lies in witnessing the attempt of a famous progeny to forge his own creative path as Demy's struggle with artistic inheritance resonates throughout unmoored Martin's voyage between past and present
A French man follows his quest to find out more about his estranged mother following her death in Venice California
Often hypnotic this small well-acted piece focuses on a middle-aged man intent on fulfilling his departed mother's final wish
This odd hybrid of in-search-of-mother quest and lurid border-town pulp shows a humane intimacy mostly in touches borrowed from the filmmaker's estimable parents
Americano which Demy also wrote and stars in is an ambivalent occasionally touching work of homage to his parents yet one whose clumsiness only underscores the superiority of their directly quoted films
The wounded characters eventually slouch toward redemption the movie they're in however isn't nearly as lucky
Demy leans heavily on a cinematic legacy that also seems to hold him back
Scenes of the director as a school-age boy in a Varda film are haunting but end up simply sparking a desire to see Varda's work It may take time for the son to catch his own wave
The film's appeal has less to do with plot than mood Demy balances his father's romanticism and his mother's naturalism taking cues from both
It is wistful and nostalgic and at the same time full of restless curiosity
While Hayek isn't bad Lola is a stock character and very little that transpires after her arrival recovers the interest so beautifully constructed in the beginning
A film with a compelling story though far too dependent on a single character fails to move its audience even as its own scenes somehow fail to move their protagonist
if you can't get past the flaws you could always rent it just to see Salma's exotic dance number
The film would be better if it were gentler It's broadly written and played the actors too busy telegraphing their characters' emotions to let us contemplate their faces in peace
Unfortunately its tale is so slight and simple that it  fails to say anything particularly poignant about life
Gentler and less aesthetically assaultive than s  s and Catfish but it's not necessarily any subtler or more enlightening
An intimate and well-acted drama about the technological tools in our lives and the quest of a young pregnant woman to reconcile with her long estranged mother
Small Beautifully Moving Parts is a tiny sweet gem
Small Beautifully Moving Parts isn't always completely elegant about getting its point across but its imperfections are only human - a quality as Sarah eventually realizes that can have its own appeal
Even at a lean  minutes this flimsy road movie feels at least  minutes too long
Highly agreeable funny and bright study of a pregnant woman all at sea in a world where wireless options seem to outweigh human ones in her life
This is a small film and knows exactly how to be a small film Like many New Yorker short stories its purpose is to strike a particular note and allow it to reverberate
There's a big difference between commenting on the zeitgeist and simply acknowledging it as this featherweight independent comedy demonstrates
The film is true to its title small beautiful and moving
Lazy storytelling expects a pass as indie authenticity
There's little new the intimidation techniques pet abduction home invasion feel clichd and the film trundles towards an unenlightening conclusion
Cole's film serves as a reminder to go back and watch the superior works it lifts from
It all works - just
The aim is to give us the stalker's view and most of the time it works
The visuals in Randall Cole's paranoia chiller  Arletta Avenue evoke Michael Haneke's Cach and Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window in the way they make domesticity seem terrifying
Arletta Avenue manages to use the terrorized-couple genre to provide a timely commentary on supposedly safe homes and distant wars
A particularly egregious offender in a shaky-camera era that is the cinematic equivalent of a multi-year plague of locusts
remarkably compelling
This would-be cult classic is the movie equivalent of gazing at a lava lamp for nearly two hours
Close-ups of a needle penetrating gnarled toes and a mutant slathered in what I choose to believe is bittersweet chocolate make as much sense as the scary drawings of angry vulvas hiding in a drawer
It's pretentious and definitely not for all tastes
VIDEO ESSAY Yes this movie is even worse than Battlefield Earth
Much of the time watching Beyond the Black Rainbow is accompanied by head scratching but perhaps that's the point of this trippy outing
Beyond the Black Rainbow has a doomy dreamy druggy draggy feel that's impressively sustained - until it becomes oppressive then pointless then laughable
Comprehensibility does not appear to be one of this writerdirector's goals but if someone is able to help Cosmatos marshal his raw visual talent I'll be first in line to see his second film
'Beyond' would be more interesting with limitations
While never quite dull 'Beyond the Black Rainbow' doesn't achieve all the chills it's capable of
The movie looks like it was lit by lava lamps scored on Moog synthesizers written between bong hits and acted underwater None of this is meant as praise
The product of a fevered mad auteur May prove to be one of the more rewarding and disturbing film experiences in many a year
a twisted version of  A Space Odyssey which takes place in a psychological torture chamber rather than in the whole of the universe
If  A Space Odyssey had an evil twin masquerading as a horror film this would be it Beyond the Black Rainbow culls from untold volumes of film history even as it delivers its own uniquely brilliant freak-outs
Nothing much happens in this experimental-type science fiction horror film What little does happen is at a slow-motion snail's pace
If you follow the muddled spacy film's logic throughout you deserve a merit honor badge for devotion to service beyond the call of duty
Audiences who appreciate oddball first efforts from talents such as Lynch Eraserhead Cronenberg Shivers and Jeunet Delicatessen will be thankful
The rich and strange debut of Panos Cosmatos throbs with style and portent which proves a winning combination even if it is somewhat light in the narrative department
There's much to admire about Panos Cosmatos' directorial debut but the end result is admittedly not for all tastes
Part Cronenberg part Bava and part De Palma  It's a film that manages to feel both new and long-forgotten at the same time
A film for people who might call Stalker their favorite movie of all time if only it were more opaque So you know a little audience but a passionate one
Its commentary on our fascination with law-breakers is virtually nonexistent except to the extent that the film itself revels in the doomed romanticism of its own protagonist
VIDEO Everything about Citizen Gangster seems second-rate
Morlando shows commendable focus even Cox dials it down and his movie's modest aspirations nicely reflect the condition in which Boyd his damaged charisma spent finally thrives
Writer-director Nathan Morlando leeches every last bit of color from the frame until the world around Boyd looks so dreary and drab you can almost understand his desire to liven the place up with a little theatrical mayhem
As good as Citizen Gangster is it would be even better if you could understand the dialogue
Citizen Gangster hits its marks when it's exploding the character's larger-than-life status aided in large part by Speedman's career-best turn
A good-looking but passionless affair that remains stubbornly aloof from its audience
Morlando has chosen to approach this material not with witty cynicism but with quiet and at times leaden sincerity
How could the tale of Toronto's most flamboyant bank robber be turned into such a blah seen-it-all-before film
With no firm hand guiding the proceedings this potentially interesting slice of Canadian history winds up feeling like just another Crime Doesn't Pay PS
The true moments of tension and danger in this film sing and some moments big and small will haunt the viewer
Morlando has crafted a stylishly shot and evocatively designed period piece But it's the dashing quietly charismatic Speedman who proves the main draw holding our attention even when the movie doesn't
Inspired by Boyd's story rather than literally retelling it the movie is less a gangster film than an existential allegory of choices and limitations
Citizen Gangster is not exactly riveting Speedman does the best he can in the title role He gives his character life even as the sub par script drags us along
While it might be silly to fault the doc for stopping short of a call to action for North American audiences the lack of one turns the viewer into a powerless bystander
Elicits the combination of rage and helplessness and guilty wanderlust unique to the genre with admirable thoroughness and balance
Recent newspaper coverage will provide more context and will take up  fewer minutes of your time
Although director Brian Lilla is neither a compelling storyteller nor a journalist he presents a passionate and cogent scientific argument against Chile's latest dam project in Patagonia Rising
There's plenty here to interest eco-issues followers but little to draw a larger audience For all its global context Patagonia Rising remains frustratingly local
A beautifully filmed and patiently explained assessment of a proposal to build five hydroelectric dams in the Patagonia region of Chile
A model of clarity about a topic of burning urgency namely the threat that mega-dams poses to farmers and ranchers in Chile and the planet overall
His is an important issue that needs to be discussed But it will take more than this dry doc - best left to cable TV - to do the matter justice
A well-meaning but dry and pedantic documentary the movie doesn't do much to bring fire passion or interest to this story outside of a demographic consisting of the most ardent environmentalists
A documentary that makes a good case against the building of five large dams in Chile designed to make a profit for European investors
The story of Kassim the Dream Ouma and his rise from Ugandan child soldier to world champion boxer combines serious human rights issues with incredible triumph-over-adversity sports lore
A nuanced survivor's story that memorably transcends its genre
While it may be short on insight Davidson's movie has one distinct advantage Kassim himself
Kassim the Dream's aestheticization of human despair is nearly obscene
Fueled by the nervous energy of its irrepressible subject Kassim the Dream is a lively and colorful treatment of what's thus far been a remarkable life
Troubling look at an exiled prizefighter who returns to Uganda to confront his past
Kassim Ouma has to say the least an unusual life storyThe filmmaker Kief Davidson recounts this vivid tale in the dull documentary
Full of obvious good intentions the film still suffers from a rambling narrative that leaves too many loose ends
While it tells a remarkable and disturbing story you may come away with a nagging sense that Kassim the Dream only skims the surface
Occasionally the subject matter of a documentary transcends the film's artistic construction
The abduction of innocent life
A former child soldier in Uganda the boxer Kassim continues to wrestle with the effects of the violence he witnessed and committed
Essentially a two-character piece a big part of its impact comes from the contrast of two lone figures against a vast Western landscape
Good for Nothing has a nice comic sense of the brushfire eruptions of Western violence
The title is apropos but it's also an understatement
The film's antipodean locales provide plenty of uncharted territory vast expanses of untamed land that offer endless opportunity but little guidance A man could get lost out there and Wallis does
A droll New Zealand parody with a tone so deadpan it becomes laugh-out-loud funny
there just isn't enough that happens in the film to justify a  minute running time
The background scenery is frequently more interesting than what's going on in the foreground
the movie is saying isn't this cute And it's not cute It's really really not
A slender movie of humble welcome charms
Though well acted this Kiwi-shot Western would've done better to invest more time with its leads and ditch deadpan attempts at a subplot of pursuers that has no reasonable payoff
An amusing well-shot deadpan comedy that pokes subversive fun at the American Western genre but it eventually loses comedic steam
Beauty and the Beast meets Sergio Leone in this amusing Western import
This film overflows with Kiwi humor that unfortunately will be lost on many audiences
Unfortunately Good For Nothing's references and aspirations are a bit higher than what is actually on the screen
Wallis and his lead pair play the proceedings with such deadpan earnestness that makes for an off-kilter energy that is often quite funny and more importantly consistently engaging
In a film working off tradition Good for Nothing moves to uncertain genre territory
an admirably slick production
A film of real substance that shows a timely interest in how and why gangs materialise
Gritty urban London films are two a penny these days but with Sket script and production advice from real former gang members has helped create a film that is new sincere and actually has something to say
A haunting stylised portrayal of a desolate London lingers in the memory
Sigh
Despite some confusing narrative turns writer-director Nirpal Bhogal's thriller is an impactful and authentic look at gang culture on London's meaner streets
Thanks to the posturing intrusive soundtrack and implausible clichd script it's hard to take any of it too seriously
It's a confused and confusing movie with odd good moments but has little by way of revealing insight other than the suggestion that the girl gangsters need loving parents and the protection of a nurturing family
A film that for all its grit and attitude lacks sufficient cred
Disappointingly unengaging Feels sadly quaint from our perspective today half a century into the journo-zombie infopocalypse
A literal-mindedness about Hunter S Thompson's metaphors infuses the film scary Puerto Rican natives threaten Paul and Salas during their wild nights rich white men look overstuffed in their wicker chair
There are some good things including a great soundtrack and strong performances from the likes of Giovanni Ribisi and Michael Rispoli but it is a disappointing and overlong affair
This very funny keenly observant movie meanders in the best way possible
Because the pace and trajectory changes so noticeably The Rum Diary almost feels like three different films Some may like that I didn't
You can smell the debauchery in this rum-soaked Caribbean paradise where truth plays tug-of-war against complacencyIt's a heady tale with seductive elements and Depp waltzes brilliantly into the tailor-made role
engaging and entertaining at times deadly serious in its own way with lots to say    a satisfying and often funny telling of a great true story
After all the promise of a perfect cocktail The Rum Diary quickly becomes like being the only sober person at a party where everyone else is absolutely trashed
Johnny Depp gets lost in paradise and a film with no plot
It's sort of chaotic It swings around all over the place but it's nicely done It's nicely acted and Johnny Depp's terrific
It's been so fabulously written wonderfully acted Depp is no stranger to representing the essence of Thompson and he's brilliant
For the most part it's just plodding along with the occasional dash of humour
Feels like its been squeezed out of a tube rather than shot out of a canon
A sprawling superficial sporadic story that fails to live up the expectations of it's inspiration it's star and the previous cinematic incarnations of the man
Of obvious interest to Thompson acolytes and of no obvious interest to anyone else As a fan of Thompson and Robinson I enjoyed the film's laid-back shagginess
Perhaps this material works better as a novel where Thompson would have been able to take his time developing each story as it occurred but as a film it just doesn't work
Intriguing performances help The Rum Diary successfully capture the spirit of the source material -- even if the result is a scattered piece of filmmaking
Depp and writer-director Bruce Robinson Withnail  I pack the script with pithy Hunter-isms hurling many of Thompson's euphonious locutions at us right from the opening scene
An entertaining but misfired take on the formative years of famed Gonzo journalist Hunter S Thompson
I'm glad Depp and Thompson were so close and I'm sure Hunter would have been touched by the tribute But that doesn't make it any fun for the rest of us to watch
It scores points for being that rare faith based film to show a little edge
This real-life football story fumbles the ball at every decisive juncture
The film is poorly written and directed at the most basic levels
The th Quarter confuses sympathy for empathy This story deserves better than this amateurish production
A well-acted drama that finds just the right balance between entertaining the audience and provoking them emotionally as well as intellectually It will make you stand up and cheer
Football tearjerker might be too intense for younger viewers
It cannot get past the simplest of outlooks with Waris as victim survivor or star there's little insight into she really is
A beautiful model bears eloquent witness to the butchery of female circumcision
Desert Flower is just like Pretty Woman if Pretty Woman were also about genital mutilation in Somalia which I believe it originally was
'Desert Flower' is a superbly told story with unapologetic conviction noticeable fire and the purest intentions of moving your soul The first must-see movie of the year
Luckily her cast makes up for the lapses and Kebede is especially effective at showing how triumph over culturally sanctioned brutality remains a tentative prospect at best
A lovely performance by Ethiopian supermodel-actress Liya Kebede as supermodel-activist Waris Dirie works wonders to elevate this uneven occasionally awkward but often absorbing film
Good idea mediocre presentation
Desert Flower a well-made film that depicts the remarkable life of the model Waris Dirie manages to be both a classic feel-good story and about as far from a feel-good story as you can get
A stirring story that mixes personal horror courage and eventually triumph
The broad comedy clashes with the movie's final message
The film's unabashed willingness to go from bleak topical piece on genital mutilation to guilty-pleasure glamour can be disconcerting
A gripping if uneven cinematic journey
Waris Dirie is an inspiration inside and out and so is this movie
It has a compelling message and surrounds it with biopic scenes that appear to be brought in from a different kind of movie The effect is rather unsettling
Written and directed by German filmmaker Sherry Hormann it works as well as it does because of the performances she's drawn from a solid cast
Waris' saga is one that needs to be told but this well-meaning dramatization might have had more power if it were a documentary
Mature biopic has moving drama but lacks coherence
This inspiring story of a nomad-turned-model is executed in the style of a made-for-TV movie
The film's payoff is clumsy and obvious But Kristofferson Corbin Kilmer Yoakam and Duff create indelible characters in just a few scenes each
Kris Kristofferson Val Kilmer and Dwight Yoakam are compelling in beautifully lived-in vanity-free performances but the drama's escalating dread fizzles in a farcical pileup of disaster
Decently sketched in its surrounding detail but don't expect any dramatic catharsis the track upon which Bloodworth travels is all too familiar even if runs through a neighborhood less often glimpsed
It's easier to get blood from a stone than to get entertainment value from Bloodworth
feels like a family myth you've heard since childhood a story handed down through generations
The visuals are as lingeringly rich as Carolina summers The music is supervised by the legendary T-Bone Burnett and is authentic and poignant
Bloodworth has value but there's a harsh price to be paid for the dramatic investment I'd rather recommend a crudely shortened version of the film than no film at all
Bloodworth is for the most part dominated by uninteresting pointless encounters and conversations
Anderson does a lot with very little - a wavering light a patch of darkness - and Jaswinski's script tries to break up the stage-bound monotony with a few well-timed if not particularly informative flashbacks
'I exist' is the clarion call of the characters in Vanishing on th Street just before they're vanquished into a deadly netherworld of shadows After you've seen this tedious thriller you may wish the film didn't exist at all
The promise of its opening wears off as the film wears on
A slight yet haunting thriller that replaces easy answers with the pervasive sense of unknowable evil forces at work
It's a stylish thriller that falls apart under any serious scrutiny the lack of explanation equally frustrating and compelling at the same time
Vanishing on th Street feels like a classic in the making until we get to know the main characters
This is The Twilight Zone as written by Jean Paul Sartre What audacity What vision And alas what a failure
Anderson spends most of his energy creating a mood - making Vanishing more cerebral than white-knuckle though a few more shrieks mine might have been nice
Brad Anderson's supernatural thriller is stacked to keep us guessing Initially this makes it watchably atmospheric But the inconclusive hints lead to the sense that he's withholding too much
Probably it would have made a much better Twilight Zone episode at one-third of the length but there's enough good solid genre work here to make it worthwhile
Prediction Vanishing on th St will vanish from theaters very quickly
It doesn't really progress beyond what happens in the first forty minutes
The thrill goes out of writer Anthony Jaswinski's Twilight Zone-style story long before the closing credits
Clothes minus their bodies are strewn around a darkened world in a bizarre wardrobe malfunction and kind of the opposite of airport body scanning Though why none of these highly resourceful characters thought night vision goggles is anybody's guess
A creepy high quality B movie
it's to Anderson's credit that despite a slight script this film keeps you on your toes almost right to the end
The film borrows from too many sources and almost always comes up short lacking depth character or reason
The film has a few eerie chills but they're chills in anticipation of a payoff There is no payoff
An enjoyable low-budget horror flick Vanishing on th Street has all the thrills and chills you could hope for from a film like this
Can't make heads or tails of its own ideas
A hopelessly cliche-ridden tale that wouldn't be out of place on a family-oriented cable channel but is several sizes too small for the big screen
For all its flaws and despite the limiting premise this music-themed drama works better than it should
Broken Hill with its picture-postcard shots of the vast Outback looks good and fills a niche for families
The predictability is draining hurting the lasting impact of this strange tale of unlikely musicianship However there's a curious spirit to the feature that makes it something to enjoy
It's a picture with the ambitions of a Billy Elliot but the execution of an August Rush
Pleasant in a flavored-rice-cakes kind of way
Jessica Chastain does a great job of igniting Jolene's mix of street-wise survivalist instinct and romantic soul Her performance anchors a film that has no solid grounding
Though stretched to a two-hour run time Doctorow's socially critical tale is reduced to queasy spectacle
While its lumpy story drags long before its running time is up the film serves as the perfect showcase for new star Jessica Chastain a dazzling redhead whose talent and radiance keeps its many parts watchable
This picaresque tale dawdles a bit but Chastain keeps us rooting for Jolene's survival
A picaresque tale of a young woman's sad passage through abuse marriages that retains the sardonic wit of the original story by EL Doctorow
Throughout Chastain delivers a full-bodied debut performance but she's ultimately stuck taking her wandering-soul protagonist far more seriously than it -- or the film -- deserves
One minute a guy's making Jolene patently false promises the next she's getting sodomized on her wedding night
The movie has been through as many hurdles getting here as dear sweet Jolene but sometimes the most engaging movies are the ones worth waiting for
A road movie that charts the adventures of an orphan teenager as she experiments with sexuality marriage and adultery
Downplaying Doctorow's condescending literary and class ironies Ireland creates something more like a queer-inflected Candide
Chastain an incandescent redhead with a heart-shaped face and round shining eyes does more justice to the part than it deserves
Ms Chastain digs deep Surrendering to her character's smoky voice-over and disastrous judgment the actress finds pockets of soul in a role that's part Jessica Rabbit part Marilyn Monroe
So bad it's almost but not quite good Dan Ireland's Jolene is an unusually elaborate and excruciatingly long vanity production
Jolene's main themes including the manipulation of youth the fragility of love and the suppression of individuality try to carry the wonky dialogue into complex territory
Vapid convoluted tedious and too episodic despite Jessica Chastain's charismatic performance as the seductive wounded insecure and lonely Jolene
Based on an EL Doctorow short story Jolene is an apt example of how stories about women who are in abusive relationships can be turned into sexual exploitation
Chastain proves near-heroic embodying Jolene's innate strength and incremental wisdom Yet she also makes us understand how the heroine's wobbly resistance to manipulative characters is overwhelmed time and again
More epic than it needs to be and less profound than it should be Jolene remains a watchable excursion into human frailty and foibles
Chastain has long red hair wide eyes and an even wider smile She is Jolene of course and she is appealing
Cruelly the display of sorrow never takes command with most of the film an unsatisfactory soap opera that never seizes an illuminating essence
I enjoyed Sharktopus It was a 'good Rogering' as they say in Britain and the Corman boudoir I was satisfied anyway
A movie by Homer Simpson for Homer Simpson
perhaps the best response to this essentially critic-proof monstrosity is articulated by the male adolescent tourist who on seeing the sharktopus graphically attack one of the performers at an open-air show is heard to declare Dude that's awesome
Though Sharktopus the box cover is certainly terrific Sharktopus the movie puts in very little effort to entertain
Absurdly-titled cheaply produced and executed with tongue firmly in cheek
The cinematic equivalent of eating junk food It's not particularly good - or good for you - but it's enjoyable and an indulgence in which I partake from time to time
This is the kind of single-location indie talkfest that could translate to the stage without much tweaking But pacing is brisk and perfs and writing sharp enough to engage throughout
Too unassuming for its own good
The group is frequently drunk but writer-director Joseph Infantolino's handling is lucid a necessity to keep up the sense of vague dread and walking-on-eggshell egos
None of its characters is especially interesting
Among its achievements is the kind of comfortable shaded acting we expect from seasoned professionals and a script by the director Joseph Infantolino that almost scarily captures the cadences of whining white privilege
Helena From the Wedding is written directed and played with such verve and deep unshowy feeling that its insights on these tried-and-true themes come through with rare and startling clarity
Marriage is hell Matrimony is rife with mistrust misdeeds and misconceptions But you know what's worse Being single We get it
The cast handles the material adequately enough but writerdirector Joseph Infantolino doesn't provide them with anything they and we haven't seen played out before
The picture ultimately doesn't end up anywhere but moments are accounted for nicely creating a warm bath of razors for those who prefer their onscreen relationships to be as hesitant as possible
distractingly low-rent
At times the music gets a bit samey because it's all very upbeat without the twangy heartbreak that marked an earlier generation of country stars Yet it's studded with juicy country-pop hooks
Sound is crystal-clear and unobtrusive stereoscopic footage looks great throughout the -minute feature though some weird compositional snafus scuttle the desired concert experience and the set's lack of variety makes it a fans-only proposition
Excellent D and an all-out performance by the country music star should satisfy most Kenny Chesney fans
Unapologetically dopey and undeniably ingratiating the supersized Kenny Chesney Summer in D makes a surprisingly convincing argument for big dumb likability
The numbers --  million records sold  number-one hits more than one million tickets sold in each of the last eight summers -- are as staggeringly impressive as remarkable as the man behind them is not
The faithful will devour it but everyone else will wonder why it takes a dozen band members including a horn section copious shots of Kenny's bulging biceps and not one not two but -Ds to give shape to these tunes
There's enough rosy-cheeked drama triumph and sacrifice for a ready-made Hollywood remake
Throughout the film circles around the sociological significance of the rodeo
There's a potentially more interesting follow-up doc ghosting right behind this one
These are vivid flawed even introspective characters And they're classic American strivers With rodeo but not just that they hope to go beyond where they have been
Informally sketched but deeply felt
Interesting but uncritically nave look at male and female convicts in Oklahoma competing in one of the nation's last two prison rodeos
If only one character in Stone reacted as someone in his position would to the preposterous situation at hand the movie would be  minutes long
A 'serious' intent and an ill-fitting hilljack argot reduce Stone to a pebble of a fil
Watching these three actors burrow like ticks into the underbelly of John Curran's murky moral drama should be enough of a reason to recommend Stone and it almost is
With its excess of blatant symbolism and illogical character turns what could have been a halfway decent exploration of personal ethics turns into a half-assed excuse for entertainment
Stone is a movie about fragile souls About how fragile we all are
There's an obvious difference between elegant underplaying and merely going through the motions and while say Michael Caine still excels at the former De Niro has sadly become a master of the latter
Like a celluloid 'American Gothic''Stone' does not paint a pretty picture
Set up as a familiar noir plot the film veers off into unexpected places keeping the audience guessing as to the main characters' motivations well after the credits roll
When did Robert De Niro stop trying When did he start coasting on his well-deserved reputation either mocking it in crass comedies or sleepwalking through dramas where fans filled in the missing emotions for him
Seems as weary as the Detroit parole caseworker Robert De Niro plays
This film has the kind of suspense where you know something bad is going to happen but instead of just getting it over with the film drags it out way too long
Dark and disturbing this drama holds our interest due to the strong acting and provocative issues swirling around in the story But it's a little heavy-handed in its desire to convey something important
An engrossing drama about the difficulty people have believing in forgiveness or in turning one's life around
Stone ultimately feels more confounding rather than profound but it will have you thinking after its credits have rolled
Great performances from the cast in this engrossing drama
Stone is an unusual film which shifts uneasily between sleaze and philosophy but it's distinguished at all times by three luminous performances
It's got something to say What that something is though -- besides a four character study in spiritual decay -- is sort of up to you
A prisoner and parole officer grapple with sins and the need for redemption in this subtle drama of parallel lives
Stone is a flawed film largely because Lucetta is a B-movie seductress preying on believable human beings with backgrounds and complicated hearts
Hard to believe but Edward Norton in cornrows is one of the less ludicrous things you'll see in this film
Zesty fun for its actors Feast is at once a sly parody of the celebrity-chef culture spawned by all the cable cooking shows and competitions and a creepy little chamber-piece
Beyond its creepy back story the horror in this morally confused and cinematically inert film is entirely nominal
Bitter Feast could have packed a satirical punch
A tasty dish that puts both sides of the critical world under the microscope
A low-budget well-paced impressively performed and quietly engaging indie horror flick
Bitter Feast is like a meal that begins with a tasty light appetizer but winds up with a too-heavy dessert that makes you wish you hadn't taken that last bite

'Legend of the Guardians The Owls of Ga'Hoole' is just as suited to fans of Harry Potter as it is to older children who will want to enjoy this fantasy adventure
Such gorgeous feathery violence
full review at Movies for the Masses
The film makes an attempt at mystical magic but it never overcomes the obstacles that the it sets for itself
there is no denying those pretty pictures and they go a long way toward making the movie watchable
Had everything it needed to be unique but instead it emerges as unmemorable and run-of-the-mill
a pretty amazing step forward for a major studio work of animation
Elements of the story drag on longer than expected but the film is lifted up by its dynamic visuals exciting set pieces and terrific voice cast
This -D animated film is for the birds
Legends Of The Guardians is nonetheless an excellent adventure that comes with plenty of heart spectacle and that welcome darker edge that helps make a family movie great
The repetition fatigue that plagued  also weakens Legend of the Guardians but otherwise it's an entertaining action-packed fable
Only the most saintly of viewers could forgive the film all of its storytelling lapses but there's always going to be some stupidly gorgeous tableau to hold your attention
It's tough-minded and anything but happy
A wrong-headed and milling attempt at a final conflict tale like the Fellowship of the Ring
It's a shame that the painstaking work of the CGI animators was ultimately doomed to failure by the script
the story's inherent sense of fantasy and genuinely felt moments of exhilarationand dangerkeeps us engaged - for a time at least
While it was a delight to look at it might have been something really special had it had a stronger more compelling story behind it
In an age of let's all get along pabulum there's much to like in a cartoon not afraid to show its talons
a thrilling and exciting tale that the whole family can enjoy
Some of the gags about s Hollywood are priceless among them a parody of Gene Kelly's dream ballets
This started life as a Broadway comedy and remains very theatrical despite Tashlin's efforts to goose it into life
On the whole Susan Slept Here remains as familiar as a summer breeze but not nearly as refreshing
Some  minutes of well-farced escapism is offered in Susan Slept Here
One scene finds Debbie Reynolds using the golden head of the trademarked Oscar statuette as a makeshift hammer to crack walnuts In Hollywood that may have been as shocking as the sight of the desecrated statue of the Virgin Mary in 'The Exorcist'
It's a surprisingly bad outing considering all the talent involved
Jaffa is modeled on semi-glossy Egyptian mellers but Yedaya lets the air out leaving empty characters with no connections to each other or the audience Best seen as a temporary blip in a promising career
An absorbing and touching family drama set in the Israeli seaside town of the title
Jaffa's schematic plot predictably developed with stock characters that are never fleshed out is insufficient to carry her pallid observations
full review at Movies for the Masses
The battle between love and hatred for Arabs in one Jewish family in Jaffa
an engaging sporadically enthralling little drama
What would make South of the Border a better movie is an Oliverstonectomy
One can't help but feeling that this particular cinma-vrit leans a lot more towards 'cinema' than 'vrit'
Disjointed shallow slim and skittish
It has plenty of value as a straightforward primer on a side of South American politics rarely given much coverage
Stone is justifiably angry at America's clandestine interference in the domestic politics of its neighbours and at the media's collusion in demonising figures like Chavez
At least Stone is getting a provocative alternative viewpoint across -- and in an engaging and entertaining way too
Risks alienating even those who instinctively side with Stone's political agenda
Lacks the balance you'd expect in a documentary
Like the best of Stone's narrative fiction South Of The Border is packed with big characters and epic storytelling That this is non-fiction makes it all the more gripping
Oliver Stone proves himself to be the anti-Michael Moore he speaks softly understanding that it must be the voices of Chavez Morales Castro et al that resonate most profoundly
Stone has a crucial overlooked viewpoint to impart but as a documentary filmmaker his content and technique are not terribly engaging
What's frustrating about the film is that even though it's clear Stone is making a number of valid and important points about both media manipulation and America's untoward political influence he's also so obviously biased in his reporting
A missed opportunity to tell us more than Fox News is bias
The film is one-sided but it's a side rarely seen by US audiences most of whom get their news from sources including FOX CNN and even The New York Times Stone skewers the lot
While it may sound dry on the surface Stone packs his movie with enough provocative insights to keep the audience invested
The DVD is chock-a-block with -minutes of extras that make a value-added package worth renting
Worth watching while keeping its bias in mind as an introduction to the political events in South America during the last decade
SOUTH OF THE BORDER points to the need of a good contemporary study of South American political movement rather than actually filling that vacancy
There is much still to uncover South of the Border and Stone has only sold us one side of itwith so much left to uncover South of the Border is missing it's edge
Having been conquered liberated invaded beaten killed and 'Christianized' for centuries it is cheering to see the collective progress made by most South American countries in mapping their futures by governing themselves
One of Herzog's quirky misfires
Easily the most fascinatingly freaky film to come along since The Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans Herzog's previous bizarro take on the cop movie genre
It's more of a curiosity than an actual film and barely even works as that For hardcore Lynch or Herzog fans only and even they should be prepared for something of a disappointment
This is Herzog pursuing ideas that fascinate him almost without recourse to whether or not they work wildly interesting almost too interesting to handle
A film that gets increasingly under our skin as it goes along tying up loose ends along the way while leaving other things maddeningly out of reach
Directed and co-written by Herzog with Herbert Golder and executive produced by Lynchthe film offers a whiff of originality in a sea of cinema schlock But compared to both filmmakers' prior works it's nowhere near as memorable
Both baffling and mystifying the film details a descent into madness with God in a boombox worshipped oatmeal boxes and the designated lunatic's proclaimed mantra minus reference to any white whale though flamingos may be implicated as Call Me Farouk
Enjoyably weird thriller that's a treat for fans of both Herzog and Lynch with a superb script and great performances from a terrific ensemble cast
Like many of the characters the plot is under-developed yet My Son My Son lingers in the brain and is essential viewing for Herzog and Lynch fans alike
This is a must for Herzog and Lynch fans
My Son My Son may be a minor work in the Herzog canon but it's still one of the more fascinating frustrating disturbing and beautiful experiences available to cinemagoers this year
The nods to Aguirre Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo won't go unnoticed but the more obtuse touches that bear the stamp of executive producer David Lynch may prove too eclectically eccentric
Unsettling but in a good way
My Son My Son What Have Ye Done finds God in a cereal box and Satan on an ostrich farm
Oddly understated it's nevertheless as unnerving a vision of disintegration in suburbia as you'd expect from director Werner Herzog and producer David Lynch
It's like Psycho remade by Ed Wood
It is a film that addresses itself directly to the audience of Lynch and Herzog and sets out in its own special way to razzle them dazzle them razzle dazzle them
More like a bad dream than a good film
The version of madness displayed by Michael Shannon's Brad is not typically dramatic it's mostly just strange and dances the line bordering on goofiness
What they deliver is the sort of fake mysticism that usually ensues when secular intellectuals try to plumb the depths of religious faith
Slides into unexceptional melodrama as the films two threads distract from rather than reinforce each other
In spite of the material's regional origins Stuart's movie still feels like a Hollywood vision of the rural South less syrupy than some but no less vague
Blood Done Sign My Name may not be great cinema but it nonetheless deserves attention
A sturdy and sensitive drama about the Civil Rights movement in Oxford North Carolina in  it rings true and reveals the scourge of American racism in all of its ugly manifestations
Its intended audience is anyone with enough heart to be horrified by the events it depicts but also with enough plausible deniability to point the finger of blame at someone else It's a movie you can feel good about feeling bad about
The movie punches up the kinds of scenes you've seen done better  other times -- church sermons a sham trial a Klan meeting
The civil rights movement like the Civil War is best known for its great battles and great leaders But there were smaller skirmishes just as important and Blood Done Sign My Name tells the story of one
Compelling moments abound but they're conveyed in such a faithful grounded manner that the cinematic appeal is lost
Beautifully shot and well-acted if earnest overlong and unfocused
The story is well-told and well worth telling
Has some wrenching moments but generally offers the melodrama and unremarkable performances of a TV movie
What the film lacks in psychological nuance it makes up for in unassuming intimate social observation
Along the way there are many fine precisely observed moments showing what race relations were like in this little tobacco town at the turn of the decade
Though it can't quite transcend its filmmaker's earnest intentions this solemn history lesson offers several powerful moments
I challenge anyone who sincerely believes that The Blind Side is a good film to take a look at this one and see how this kind of story is meant to be told
If you can get past its moribund title you'll still have a challenge in spotting the protagonist in this oddly washed-out depiction of a racial battle that raged in Oxford North Carolina
If this were a s TV movie it probably would have won a boatload of Emmys Now it lacks impact although parents or grandparents worried their children don't appreciate the sacrifices of decades past might want to use it as a teaching tool
You can't deny the inspirational qualities of the story or Parker's screen presence any more than you could accuse the film of subtlety or of masking its conspicuous pro-Christian agenda
The acting like the storytelling is quietly convincing
Riveting Real-Life Civil Rights-Era Drama Released on DVD
Well-enough executed for a flick on a modest budget to forgive the tendency towards melodrama With a tenderhearted payoff arriving when the Prodigal Daughter asks her father for forgiveness during a teachable moment of mutual redemption
Stan Foster's film confirms the unique undeniable power this genre can achieve on both stage and film
Crowd-pleasing heartfelt and inspirational It's a wonderful uplifting and life-affirming movie
Too many of the performances are too broad with actors hitting the jokes and the slang as if they're auditioning for a revival of Good Times or
I wish the film had hit a little harder or had a few unpredictable plot elements but as far as Christian movies aiming to make mainstream headway are concerned this is certainly one of the better ones I've seen
I find the plot developments to be pretty predictable and the resolutions tend to be a little too easy
Change of Plans Danile Thompson's skillfully executed comedy of manners is either deeply profound or insupportably shallow--most likely the latter
A comedy of manners in need of Ritalin
Even the film's galaxy of stars can't keep this black hole of c'est la vie soap-operatics from collapsing upon itself
Middling middle-class entertainment aimed at the midpoint between comedy and drama mass appeal and sophistication Change of Plans is eager to please and easy to dismiss
In almost every  way Change Of Plans is smart about the transformative pace of modern life
A French film about the messy and perplexing dimensions of mid-life crises and the different ways people deal with them
The acting by Seigner Marina Hands Karin Viard Patrick Bruel and other French notables is first-rate although their characters and what they have to say are trite
Refuses to take anything too seriously staking out a middle ground between melodrama and farce
Confirmed Francophiles lovers of upscale humor and those with European leanings will be completely seduced
The next time you're invited to a French dinner party you might want to give it a pass if the tedious proceedings in Change of Plans are any indication
the light cinematic menu served here offers little more than a confusing pot au feu of guests and their problems
There's nothing even a little bit original about any of this but in a way that's the point
In sum it's a good not great movie of a type I like but that most people don't
Una comedia agridulce ms bien previsible intrascendente para nada memorable aunque no exenta de cierto encanto inocente
A tasty French romantic comedy diversion with just a touch of seriousness thrown into the mix
Supported by mild jokes and concluding with a trough of trivial narrative closures 'Change of Plans' not only fails to offer anything original Oh Voltaire the direction is noticeable for its incompetence
Suggests Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood but without the gallows humor or eye for regional detail
Saitzyk's sappy pontifications on loss redemption and zealotry don't register as headily as they're meant to and the spirituality invoked feels about as sincere as the Christian who only attends Christmas mass
Earnest to a fault this tale of vengeance and retribution strives for Faulknerian pathos but never rises above amateur theatrics
The location -- Sarah Palin's beautiful old stomping ground of Wasilla Alaska -- is the main attraction in Robert Saitzyk's talky and overwrought melodrama
Opens tentatively but ends confidently with a climax that's bloody enough to jolt but not enough to sicken -- a trick that too many directors have yet to master
Often contrived stilted and awkwardly preachy albeit occasionally suspenseful and filled with haunting visuals
This tautly wound and even more tightly paced mini-epic of love loss and redemption deep in the heart of God's country aka Alaska is nothing if not awe-inspiring
Intense brutal intriguing and expertly executed
Despite its fissures in tone and technique Godspeed occasionally plays like a sturdy indie outpost of revenge cinema
All the theological themes and delicate cinematography in the world can't alter the fact that watching someone get theirs simply makes us feel better
Of course von Trier wants us to react to be repulsed shocked offended Mission accomplished
Purely as a visual and visceral experience puckish writer-diretor Lars von Trier produces an enormously powerful phantasmagoria that deals with and reproduces the effects of fear and depression
Wildly inconsistent veering from boredom to moments of visual beauty to some of the most ghastly gruesomeness ever seen on screen
Despite some strikingly flourishes von Trier's latest makes him look less like a mad genius and more like he's simply mad
Built on a shallow premise designed to cheaply evoke feelings of disgust while elaborating on a simplistic theme
It's a far cry from Nicolas Roeg's excellent  chiller Don't Look Now which maintains a high-gloss art-house sheen yet draws us into its similar story of a couple coping with the drowning death of their child
A grim film that wants you to feel the pain its characters do
A beautiful and ultimately very sad film
Functioning as the inverse of the Biblical creation story Antichrist is the most unique and divisive 'horror' film you are ever likely to see
Von Trier tests not just the audience's tolerance for blood-soaked images of genital mutilation but also our ability to stay awake during some colossally boring and pretentious stretches of filmmaking
Von Trier is a prankster so any attempt to guess at WTF he had in mind could just end up with the Danish auteur pulling your leg The Fox may have said it bestChaos Reigns
It is unrelenting terrifying and profoundly powerful And it is really really ballsy a claim that viewers will recognise as being highly ironic considering the ball-related events that take place within the film
another provocation that is at once beautiful and perverse personal and cynical and filled with his sour vision
It's audacious gruesome and pushes to the extreme limits of acceptable cinema content but it is never any of those things to exclude ordinary viewers
Before this movie goes careening desperately hysterically insanely off the rails this is an ambitious scary peek into pulsating evil human hurt
Because of its impassioned conviction placing it on a scale of value is practically irrelevant
Von Trier admits he has no idea what any of this s--- means but only a filmmaker of his skill could make such an inchoate mess so strangely entertaining
absurdly abstract in a way von Trier's best films are not
There will be no thumbs up or down  The film is neither disgusting  nor is it one of the great films It is a transitional work made by an artist clearly in crisis
A confrontational film that dances between the sublime the mundane and the shocking with little to no regard for audience expectations
I still don't get the big deal with Harry Potter but the passion and love transferred through a positive outlet will appeal to anyone
Koury goes back and forth among the threads but he could have used a few more threads and his camera was not always on the most interesting material
How the dynamic between inspiration and creation operates is a topic that We Are Wizards tantalizingly puts forward but fails to fully examine
Ignore the scattershot approach however and there's considerable pleasure to be had in spending time with these bizarre enthusiasts and watching the creative ways they find to express their obsessions
Among movies about fans' obsessive fixations on fictional universes the film registers neither as bemusedly distanced as Trekkies nor as dramatically engaged as King of Kong
A better approach would have been one that focused less on a child's home movies and performances and more on why he's on stage singing about an imaginary wizard
There's ultimately very little to take the movie beyond the realm of pleasantly diverting DVD bonus feature
Koury does a masterful job emphasizing literacy and purity of spirit in Wizards assembling an often delightful documentary that celebrates the tight cultural grip of Potter and its fringe pastimes
astoundingly irritating
The filmmaker Josh Koury has latched onto a great subject for We Are Wizards his peek at some of the more engaged fans circulating in the Harry Potter world
A fun project that doesn't quite reach its potential Josh Koury's doc is still worthwhile for anyone who can't wait until  to see Harry Potter back on the big screen
Mostly We Are Wizards is a loving if flawed tribute to creativity and artistic freedom
Josh Koury's lighthearted documentary may only appeal to the faithful but apparently the faithful comprises an enormous number of people
Harry Potter addicts may get a kick out of this documentary
Director Koury doesn't make any points in We Are Wizards particularly but he stylishly shares the love
As with most uncontrollable pop-cultural phenomena the various groups and organizations that have popped up around the Harry Potter franchise are more fascinating than the bespectacled object of their slavish devotion
Josh Koury's documentary about hardcore Harry Potter fans meandering and amiable reveals that resistance to consumer culture is pretty much futile
Breakthrough film maker Josh Koury's latest documentary manages to go to the head of the parade of Potter fans but the average viewer may not be sure why he went to the trouble
The documentary sweetly focuses our attention on the way human creativity transforms everything around it Often in the nuttiest of ways true But still it's a good thing
Only for the most drooling of fanboys
At the centre of this film is the luminous Pfeiffer who knows only too well the ravages of time in an industry where youth and beauty are so valued
Stretching out like a cat on the wide screen Michelle Pfeiffer shows off her durable glamour in the star role of Lea de Lonval a high-class courtesan in pre-World War I France
The challenge here is to make a film in which the protagonists frequently say one thing and feel another It's a film which has to work on two levels and it does
Remember Boyle and MacDonald's names you'll be hearing them a lot when awards season comes around
What a drag it is getting old
Sadly the few good elements of Cheri only serve to highlight the films considerable inadequacies and the only bedroom-based action it will inspire is a comforting nap possibly before the end of the film
The film is a comedy of manners with a powerful undercurrent of tragedy Cheri is funny sad and charming and the ending may shock you
A limp whore's tale set in the turn of the th-century in Paris
Scene after scene unfolds with colourful costumes attractive sets knowing glances and innuendo but also a feeling that this is a pedestrian read-through of a stage play
The chemistry of these performers makes it not just believable but almost inevitable emotionally guarded beauties who inadvertently allow affection into their relationship
Clever charming and slightly superficial Cheri is the kind of pert period piece that gets by on a great deal of creative goodwill
Frears does a fine job of capturing the look of turn-of-the-century France as well as the essence of Colette's story
Pretty yet uneven Cheri could have been much more had the details in its story matched that in its production design
Director Stephen Frears made a nice job of The Queen but this is 'King awful
Un correcto cuadro de poca entre la comedia picaresca y el drama romntico con slo una excusa para verlo el regreso protagnico de Michelle Pfeiffer
Gallic liaisons that aren't especially dangerous - or intriguing
full review at Movies for the Masses
For a movie that is so steeped in sex and carries an R rating there's a pretty scant amount of titillating sex
Insubstantial bit of fluff with whores sitting around dishing each other
Pfeiffer maintains her poise throughout It's not her performance that limits Chri it's the script which too thin to support the emotional weight it's expected to bear
Brett Simon's clever high school noir debut is more Heathers than John Hughes
Basically Brick for remedial viewers
Doesn't find enough novel insights to make for essential viewing
Assassination has a meandering plot line that dithers when it should drive forward and lingers at times it should leap ahead
Depending on your personal taste the following statement may make or break Assassination for you the movie is cute
The flick plays like Rushmore meets The Usual Suspects alongside shout-outs to everything from Sixteen Candles to Chinatown to Fast Times at Ridgemont High
Brett Simon's Assassination of a High School President is a small and pleasant surprise
The entire film wants to be a carbon copy of Rushmore with the addition of dark slickness and the omission of general quality
Superbad meets grossout noir boasting tangy teen dirty talk so thick you could cut it with a well sharpened pencil Which by the way somebody does more than once
The noir pastiche is sitcom-ish the characters vestigial and the satire of high school so compromised I wondered if cowriters Tim Calpin and Kevin Jakubowski weren't home-schooled
Well acted a slick story and excellent animation make this a home DVD release worth checking out
The story's action and adventure move along at the pace you'd expect from a direct-to-video animation
File under disappointing but not outright bad
Superhero tales are best when they strive for some complexity this one has an engrossing plot and some solid character development that grown-ups can appreciate
A literally colorful action-adventure plotbut fails to replicate the success of February's Wonder Woman at making its leading character not just kick-ass but fascinating Blu-ray
More interested in the villain than the hero First Flight is a bland look at one of the sides of the DC universe that's normally much more interesting
Johnson and co-writer Ishmael Chawla have a light touch that keeps things from turning overly melodramatic
Chris Mason Johnson's ensemble drama could've been just another earnest time capsule about friends in their late twenties what saves it from devolving into mere mumblecore is a broader-than-average outlook
Earnest performances can't help the warmed-over sitcom quality
Imperfect but worthwhile
The movie is admirable for taking these people seriously even if it does little to illuminate their individual or cultural significance
There's nothing particularly new or moving in this study of friends growing up and apart from one another which only makes you want to yell Move on College was ten years ago
Lacing timeless group dynamics with current concerns Johnson straddles the line between glossy fluff and serious generational inquiry
Chris Mason Johnson directs from a script he co-wrote giving us little reason to care for his physically attractive emotionally empty characters
Has interesting characters and a terrific cast but feels somewhat contrived bland and lacking an authentic emotional resonance
There's something uniquely irritating about the kind of too-serious-for-its-own-good alternative-lifestyle drama subheading that Chris Mason Johnson's The New Twenty neatly falls under
Co-writerdirector Chris Mason Johnson's amateur debut effort could be credited with creating a new genre of pretentious triteness tailored to define of the pop slang word Redonkulous
Johnson provides them with plenty of challenges and reasons to question their values priorities and goals
Writerdirector Chris Mason Johnson is a sharp observer of urban life and his story moves along so briskly that you won't spend much time considering the fact that it should have been set in
The director and co-writer Ishmael Chawla never make their characters venal
Watching it's easy to feel a little stranded too
If there's cautionary moral here it's that a girl should never introduce herself to a prospective lover as being hardcore
With its awful ending the whole film ends up as embarrassing as telling someone what it is you've just watched
Violent sex-filled thriller is rough grisly stuff
An exciting high-tensioned fast-paced tale of seven people faced with life-altering decisions when removed from civilization in the mold of Lord of the Flies
The ending is never much in doubt Getting to it however involves a slightly better-than-usual assortment of cheap harrowing thrills
Anyone looking for a stoned and bikinied update of L'Avventura Purple Noon Dead Calm or other boat-bound chillers will have to settle for The Real World Death Yacht
Had director Blackburn included at least one interesting character that wasn't bird-brained and had he moved the mayhem much earlier within the plot the film would have been at least refreshing to watch rather than mostly dull and derivative
On the plus side at least it wasn't called Dirty Sanchez
Unfortunately Donkey Punch delivers a donkey punch of its own
It's Dead Calm meets Very Bad Things with English accents
I look forward to Blackburn making a thriller with a script to match his style
has been infused with an egregiously plodding sensibility that effectively renders its few positive attributes moot
Donkey Punch is almost humorless and there's no wink and nudge behind the mayhem to absolve us of taking its ugly class-obsessed subtext seriously
Packs a magnetic jolt of fearsome intensity
Very Bad Things meets Knife in the Water in  this thriller about not-so-bright young things trying to cover up a nasty accident
A first class thriller from start to finish Donkey Punch has the lot raunchy holiday fun gorgeous locations a luxury yacht drug-driven sex orgy and a mishap
A nasty little thriller that might have worked had it tempered its propensity for outrageous brutality
Blackburn takes one boat one body a rising tide of panic and a rising number of corpses and uses them all to craft the best bad news possible
At least there's not a bag-head haunting the ship
Perhaps a shade too long to hold the youngest viewers in permanent thrall this is a family film in the truest sense - only the grouchiest bear won't find something to like
Kids will be hooked but adult viewers may yearn for something a bit racier with fewer cute field-mice and more fox fucking
This isn't Fantastic Mr Fox it's just an ordinary vixen who I wished would stay well away from this tiresome child and let her make some friends with someone of her own age and species
The main problem is it's so incredibly slow as we're forced to endure the unnamed girl's patient attempts to gain the animal's trust while the youngster herself is too wide-eyed for her own good
There is little insight into the life of this resourceful creature and it certainly will not educate your cubs
There seems no other reason to tell this rambling glutinous tale - other than for us to go ooh aah at the scenery the seasons and the melting-eyed close-ups of Reynard the heart-throb
Kate Winslet does a syrupy voice-over to this bedtime story but given what we know of foxes it's a tough one to swallow
Children will undoubtedly adore the film and the local tourist board will probably have to take its phones off the hook
Gorgeously scenery and a virtually dialog-free script lends this film an almost fairy tale quality that makes the most of the astonishing camerawork And this almost makes it bearable as it heads into a rather cloying finale
The Tally-ho brigade may need an extra snifter of sherry if they see Jacquet's new film It's about to do for foxes what Babe did for pigs back in
If for example Alvin and the Chipmunks is a children's movie then The Fox and the Child is a children's movie for children who'd prefer to hang out at the local arthouse cinema than at the multiplex
Exquisite cinematography and a beautifully told story about the unlikely friendship between a little girl and a wild fox make this a magical experience
A strange mix of docofairy tale this film does have beautiful cinematography but is let down by inconsistencies in tone
Luc Jacquet doesn't do great narration but he does animals really well
It's very beautiful but it's so contrived
There's plenty of scope for sentimental tears but I hope most children will go away with something punchier - a longing to observe the natural world in this much detail and a new respect for the difference between owning something and loving it
The Fox and the Child is more than a wildlife documentary It invites us to contemplate alternative worlds of sensation and experience to enter the consciousness of other species to explore our contacts with them
The result is Nature seen through the eyes of a solitary and fanciful child with Jacquet intensifying the theatricality of it all by playing around with scale amplifying every sound and raising the wildlife count
Falls shy of being either a captivating tale for kids or an enlightening documentary for adults
A gentle rambling adventure in the wild
If you're looking for a horror flick that wants to give you a 'you are there -- and it's freaking miserable' vibe this one should fit the bill quite nicely
Aussie mayhem with cannibalistic inbred idiots and upper middle class whitebread victims fails to set this film apart But great fun nonetheless
Even by the low standards of other horror-movie victims the foursome here seem blithely clueless always splitting up for no good reason and running headlong into ambushes
Grisly as it needs to be Dying Breed is nevertheless quite a sophisticated horror film layered with elements and peopled with leading characters who are more than stereotypes thanks also to top performances
There is no civic responsibility in horror You can insult whomever you like so long as you make it scary This one has a few good moments but not enough to rattle one's bones
Right from the opening credits with their strangely beautiful blown-up images of blood and the accompanying darkly rhythmic score you're primed for something terrible to happen
It's a textbook gorefest Give it a miss if you don't like blood
It tries hard to be horrific and gruesome even introducing a bit of fashionable torture near the end but only the most credulous will find it genuinely scary
The setting is the island of Tasmania rather than the Australian outback but after WOLF CREEK and STORM WARNING any city folk stupid enough to wander this far off the track deserve whatever they get - and boy do they get it
If Geoffrey Hall's cinematography is eerily beautiful capturing the isolation and subdued menace of the Tasmanian hinterlands then there is little else in Dying Breed that to quote protagonist Nina nobody's ever seen before
Writer-director Nick Gaglia has fashioned a documentary-style drama that is too narratively disjointed to achieve maximum impact but too emotionally potent in fits and starts to be dismissed out of hand
Over the GW is appropriately troubling in its evocation of humanity's penchant for self-destruction
Overall the performances are surprisingly convincing but the mockumentary elements feel out of place and the intrusive switching between BW and color denotes nothing it's just a gratuitous flourish that detracts from the raw story material
Both newcomers the two leads impress as does veteran actor Albert Insinnia as the center's psycho director
Over the G W follows a troubled brother and sister as they are committed to a New Jersey treatment center by their well-meaning parents
An earnest but amateurish look at a cultlike rehab Nick Gaglia's semiautobiographical debut feature means well Then again so did his parents when they condemned him and his sister to a sadistic substance-abuse program
An undeniably personal if amateurish psychodrama Gaglia's torture re-creations become rote quickly and his cross-processed color-tinted randomly inserted over-zoomed Film School  indulgences need their meds adjusted
At a mere  minutes the movie skips past what seems like lots of crucial exposition in favor of vague flashbacks and confusing inserts
A thought provoking film that touches on issues of climate change as well as the killing of whales and includes compelling images of the great mammals themselves as they respond to the calling
Made with the passion of the committed and the sincerity of the believer Whaledreamers is both an ecological and a spiritual film urging us to consider the upside of harmony and the downside of ignorance
The September  segment is one of the clumsiest works of montage you're likely to see
There's maybe an excess of hugging in the film but that doesn't really detract from what are some quite amazing and moving moments
Scattershot often beautiful to look at and just as often earnest to the point of self-parody
Whaledreamers is clearly a labor of love and a call to action but it's undermined by the sheer volume of topics it tackles in addition to the main subject
goofy fun in its own way But it's the same goofy fun we've seen in dozens of other films for years now by Argento and others
Asia Argento's outright horrendous performance ruins what could have been a decent B-movie
A gruesome drama enacted by a cast that speaks English with a bewildering variety of accents Mother of Tears is reliably gruesome and occasionally startling but not particularly scary
So although Argento may not be in peak form he does seem to be enjoying himself and there are still flashes of the old master
Just as twisted surprising and gruesome as anything that Argento has given us in the past and a more than worthy successor to its two predecessors
Mother of Tears feels like a copy like someone doing Argento instead of the real deal that it could have been
Mother of Tears is contrived confused clumsy and quite simply dreadful
the concluding chapter of Argento's Three Mothers trilogy dispenses with the overt stylization of its predecessors  in favor of a sobering dose of realism
A very entertaining fiasco
A real shame
Should be locked away for the sake of mankind
We come to an Argento picture for the surreal Baroque imagery and though much here fits those descriptions there's a great deal of it that's also quite gaudy and goofy and dare I say campy
I wanted this to be great Hell I would have settled for just above average This just sucks All of the key elements are in place -- a solid story great gore FX good sound work  everything except Dario
Argento's nightmare vision is vivid enough to overcome the weaker aspects and make this a commendable if not entirely satisfying closing to his supernatural trilogy
Argento's gothic hokey horror homage to sleazy sorceress boobs demon damsels with too much makeup and assorted cannibalistic weirdos run amok Girl witches gone wild Italian style
Mother of Tears puts a dent in Argento's rep as a horror maestro
Mother of Tears may not stand tall in Argento's body of viscera-laden work but this final chapter of a loosely defined trilogy is refreshingly old school in its trashiness
Aside from being vile and repellent it's mainly dull -- old-fashioned in its shock tactics and culminating in a ho-hum climax
Argento is admired for his voluptuous use of color and his operatic bloodletting this is lovely to look at if you can stand to
Super nudity and graphic sadism substitute for suggestiveness and technology ups the gore but makes it cinematic common
The impression that remains after the credits roll however is of exemplary American filmmaking whose direction and superb performances make up for a solemn script
David Strathairn's Finn is the nearly broken perplexed downcast and also oddly humorous Chaplinesque figure whose own transformative experienced 'sensation of sight' imparts a tentative metaphorical healing vision of a restored life
The really oppressive thing here is the filmmaking itself
At  angst-filled minutes The Sensation of Sight might tax your patience but there are rewards for the persistent
ItTMs moving occasionally charming and universally well-actedBut with its pretensions to profunditythe film like its hero can get stuck inside its own head
It's a terrible pity that this ensemble drama about people hurting and coping in small-town America is so relentlessly dull
A mildly embarrassing vanity project
A highly satisfying old-fashioned comedy-dramawith a strong undercurrent of religion and philosophy that helps Hunt make her film profound in a way that sneaks up on you Blu-ray
What at first seems a morose if witty romantic comedy for adults ends up being an altogether more serious piece about a woman acquiring children but leaving behind childish things
Colin Firth  he steams a bit for a change in a tale that's strictly so-soap
Helen Hunt makes an impressive directorial debut and gives a defiantly vanity-free performance in this engaging drama that also features strong support from Colin Firth and Bette Midler
A bittersweet combination of comedy and drama this sensitive film has enough strong material in it to make it worth seeing even if it sometimes feels under-developed and a little too heart-tugging
There's food for thought in the pregnancy plot although the narrative drags its heels towards a misty-eyed conclusion
Hunt's film does soften the heart not least because of its honesty and its sensitivity to some unfashionable dilemmas
The tut-tuttingly dull script refuses to supply a single happy line until Hunt squares up to the sudden arrival of Bette Midler
It's not the only misstep in Oscar-winning actress Helen Hunt's first film as director which is a shame because she does a lot of things right
It's a glum and amateurish business on the three-in-one subject of adoption - being adopted having your child adopted and adopting one
This is not without its attractions - an occasionally waspishly witty script and some unexpected dramatic tangents - but the characters never seem more than a casually bagged collection of tics and mannerisms
All in all not quite as good as it gets
Unendurable American middle-aged whingeing
Given its cast and source material - Elinor Lipman's highly-regarded novel - it all makes for a highly disappointing experience
The loudest laughs in this serious comedy came from three brief appearances by author Salman Rushdie as a doctor
Hunt's lovely voice pitched in that diurnal-dizzy limbo between mezzo and soprano is perfect for mid-life crisis So is her gawky strung-out tragicomical body language
Everyone acts decently and you have to praise Hunt for her tenacity But this suffers from some fairly dire cinematography and a manufactured air that prevents the watcher connecting to the whole thing
Unexpectedly sharp light and appealing a testament to Hunt's skills behind the camera
Trying to establish a serio-comic tone is a task best suited for seasoned directors Given that a boom microphone drops into the film frame at least twice Hunt has more basic production elements to master
CJ acknowledges the clichs sometimes embracing and sometimes satirizing the conventional depictions of kids and adults in family films
CJ is a deceptive little delight a movie that wisely avoids the pitfalls of its obvious homage to set its own cinematic course
Always intriguing but not always fully involving CJ still features as with its resurrecting dog Chow's enlivening touch Even when his film isn't completely absorbing it seems he never met a dying genre clich he can't reanimate
This is a wildly inventive and funny film that is a breath of fresh air
Chow loves his comedic exaggerations and for good reason he executes silly with dazzling skill CJ might be a minutely less aggressive production from Chow but that doesn't make it any less unreal or hilarious
The choice between fantasy and reality is ultimately what CJ addresses and dramatises Chow's film is charming to be sure - but that is just the half of it
Chow's film is a charming funny illustration of family life that explores the notion of being given a second chance A kids' comedy with a heart
With its fast action cute critters and schoolyard antics children and fans of Kung Fu Hustle should enjoy Stephen Chow's CJ which further cements his reputation as a commercially gifted director
There are some nice surreal touches such as getting enormous adults to play two of the eight-year-olds But I can't forgive Chow for a misjudged and frankly offensive ending which is culpably evasive about the reality of life and death
Whimsical knockabout and slightly out there it's an enticing watch and one which more adventurous young audiences won't find too alien
Chow's kung fu fans may be disappointed that he's made a family film but on its own terms it's well crafted quite touching and frequently LOL
Good for kids probably of all ages
Despite its flaws this is an entertaining fantasy adventure that both kids and adults will enjoy Worth seeking out
In spite of the hole the writers dig themselves in accidentally turning the main hero in to a really unlikable presence CJ is a great twist on the boy meets alien tale
He knows he's the hundredth director to rip off ET he's just going to do it better and with jokes fit for a vintage Warner Brothers cartoon Blu-Ray
Chow's child-like sense of wonder is no guarantee that he can make a suitable film for kids
The tone veers wildly from sentimental family drama to cartoonish fantasy and some of the attempts at humor badly misfire
Diluindo seu senso de humor anrquico e cartunesco no intuito de criar um filme famlia Chow concebe apenas uma histria formulaica artificial em seu sentimentalismo barato e sem a menor graa
What charm CJ has is of the Saturday-morning variety built upon a tiresome mixture of slapstick humor and comic-book action
Has the same moral and thematic contours of ET or an old-school Disney animated fable but with the panache we've come to expect from the creator of Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle
For all its enticing dramatic hooks Choking Man has a fairly unrewarding conclusion
In this case what looks like an ambitious film-school project complete with heavy-handed sincerity experimental camera style and an overplayed central metaphor becomes gently lyrical and melancholy
Overburdened with disorienting stylistic devices and contrived plot elements that reduce the psychological depth to which it aspires
rises above the mundane with the inclusion of some gorgeous animated interludes and just a touch of Latin American-style magical realism
Impressively directed drama with strong performances and a subtle script though the tilt into magical realism doesn't quite work
It's not a bad effort at all - and certainly a whole class above Ninja Turtles
It's meant to be a portrait of a man choked by his own alienation but Jorge's shyness comes over as dullness and after all the sensitive maundering the conclusion is a terrible letdown
Modest quirky well acted by an unknown cast
After more than an hour in Jorge's relentlessly miserable company the voice in The Sneak's head was saying leave now
They don't add up to much and he's just too passive to make us care even slightly about whether he gets the girl or ends up taking a meat-cleaver to his rival
Steve Barron's darkly melancholic low-budget drama is worlds away from the blockbuster swagger of his earlier Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
It's all a bit anonymous despite engaging performances especially from Yuan as the sunny optimist but the character of Jorge is so cripplingly introverted that there's nothing to latch on to
The film marries digicam naturalism to animated fantasy to oddsome but fascinating effect rendering magical the inner world of the shy and almost muted Jorge It's an unusual but valuable addition to the cinema of contemporary migration
Some US indie films are so torpid so pointless and so incredibly whingey that you want to reach into the screen and slap the face of everyone involved This film by writer-director Steve Barron is one such
The creepy and original power of the film is the schizophrenic other who taunts him when he finally crawls home to his maggoty bedsit Weird
There's enough charm and enterprise here to win over viewers who have the patience to stick by the tongue-tied Jorge An intriguing change of direction for pop-video pioneer Barron though next time he might like to cut loose that bit more
There's a low-key New York drama lurking somewhere but Barron can't seem to decide if he's making that or something more flashy
Despite efforts to impart a little tension and human interest the tale is told with such discretion it's almost anonymous
For all its concern with social and mental disintegration Choking Man is a strangely tender film
Low-key indie
Likely to be the year's most entertaining film withheld from critics Neil Marshall's latest finds him pigging out at a B-movie buffet of bangers and mash His alchemy of anarchy in the UK is exhilarating and playfully perverse
just the umpteenth killer-virus movie of the last few years
The only thing that saves Doomsday from complete disgrace is that it knows it's trash
After they blow a bunny to smithereens aiming straight through a plot hole I knew all bets were off
When the film's unspooling and we're watching Rhona Mitra drive a sports car through an exploding bus we find ourselves in movie geek heaven
spintati pseytokaltia poy oti yposhetai sto dinei aplohera
Brimming with exploitation antics grindhouse sensibilities and heh heh exploding bunnies Doomsday conjures a future thrown back to the dead-end styles and amoral excesses of the eighties - and no future could be bleaker than that
It's a mishmash of homages to writerdirector Neil Marshall's favorite B movies That doesn't make it bad at all though it ends up being quite entertaining
The movie doesn't disguise the fact that this is a loving homage to early 's science fiction cult classics
Get your Mad Max mutant-maniacs-in-monster-machines on
A tribute to the early s anarchy actioners The Road Warrior and Escape From New York Neil Marshall's Doomsday also blends elements from  Days Later for a fun and ultra-violent action-sci-fi-kinda-horror film
Doomsday possde dfinitivement toutes les caractristiques d'un film culte en devenir mme si celles-ci nous laissent toujours en tte une curieuse impression de dj vu
A bit like a medley of greatest hits performed by a hot young talent who brings a new vocal inflection to the tired old standards
Doomsday might seem novel - if you've never seen The Road Warrior Aliens Escape from New York or any other post-apocalyptic flick before
One's enjoyment of Doomsday might stem from how much one admires a blatant homage to the s
As it slogs through one hectic yet mundane set pieces after another the film slowly drowns in its own pool of clichs
In terms of sheer excitement it's the best movie of
Marshall's adrenalin-fuelled skill and enthusiasm propel the action forward with reckless abandon
I somehow ended up admiring Doomsday for being the most unapologetically ridiculously preposterous action movie I've ever seen
a Whitman's sampler of bizarre story ideas and visual gimmicks congealing around a premise that is so straightforward that it affords them no groundwork for stability or realization
a few good tunes are not enough to turn this musical comedy into anything more than lightweight escapist fluff
It's ridiculously old-fashioned but it's also spectacular entertainment with wonderful songs a big heart and plenty of laughs
A Date with Judy is loaded with youthful zest making for gay light entertainment
Taylor is breathtakingly beautiful but Miranda walks off with every scene she's in
A Date with Judy features a song called Strictly on the Corny Side which might serve as the movie's theme song
It's a bubbly old-fashioned romanticcomedymusical
Visually dull without an ounce of cinematic purpose pic will work most effectively on the small screen
The film's plea for tolerance is commendable but would have more weight if only it were executed with more panache
Cheesy crockpot of a film
Overwritten and under-directed by Maurice Jamal the movie contains several honest moments but remains too awash in clich Cs and stereotypes to take seriously
Even though homophobia may be more of a hurdle in the 'hood than Hollywood this ensemble's supportive response to Sheldon's revealing his sexual preference proves to be a surprisingly sweet way to close out this well-meaning message movie
Mr Jamal's direction ranges from clumsy to competent Fortunately even as Mr Jamal's characters hit notes reminiscent of a half-baked television pilot they disclose eccentricities that his cast spins into comic gold
Looking for plot holes You can't miss them But if you go in hoping for a good time you'll find that too
The tone is good-natured enough to make a simple movie semi-watchable
Jamal's comedy of family dysfunction is essentially a sitcom episode writ large it's not subtle but it's good-natured and hits its marks with ruthless efficiency
By far the best of a plethora of holiday family-reunion films Maurice Jamal's warmly hilarious Dirty Laundry is particularly blessed with the presence of Loretta Devine
Is it sidesplitting No but it's cute Is it wonderfully wicked No but it's got a few twists and turns Is it a classic Probably not but it's an encouraging move into a new kind of gay film and a story not often told
run of the mill with a few good laughs along the way
Horror without suspense is like sex without love you can appreciate the technicalities but ultimately there's no reason to care
It's just not that scary even the gory sequences are predictable and boring And it certainly isn't clever or funny
It has to be said that Hatchet's homage to the goofy gloppy vivisection-fests of two decades before has a strange way of satisfying
Hatchet est un film fait par des fans pour des fans avec tout ce que cela implique en termes d'effusions de sang et de dmembrements  n'en plus finir
usually the choice between fun party and mad badness is a no-brainer - but in Hatchet viewers get the best of both worlds as carnivalesque hilarity and carnage go hand in bloody hand
Like Scream never happened this is an uneven comedy-horror homage that gets by on enthusiasm alone
What could have been a mini-Scream is ultimately I'll Always Know You Did Last Halloween the th
Green's efforts to strike a balance between knowing humour and no-holds-barred horror are stymied by an erratic tone a slow talky build-up gives way to a soggy middle section and a messy all-stops-out finale
Long before its howling bogeyman has savaged his last victim you'll be wondering if the movie has anything else to offer besides self-conscious homage
Billed as Old School American horror Hatchet's actually something far less classy a technically inept homage to 's slasher movies that's both bloody and bloody stupid
A reasonably serviceable horror with much gory dismemberment and featuring a kind of ancestor worship in the casting of scary-movie veterans Robert Englund and Tony Todd
This low-budget horror spoof lasts only  minutes but seems to take forever
Fun horror-comedy about tourists being picked off in the swamps Tongues are firmly in cheeks heads don't stay long on shoulders
Enjoyably schlocky horror flick with its tongue firmly in cheek ensuring that there are several laughs to be had amidst all the gory hatchet-wielding mayhem
This may be the bucket of blood that splatter fans were eagerly anticipating  but it is also an excellent horror film with solid scripting and strong performances that make it appealing to a wider audience
Only a brief nicely sculpted bass clarinet line provides any redeeming quality
I enjoyed Hatchet quite a bit I was never scared and I can't say I laughed out loud much but it has a very gleeful tone that invites the viewer in
Lacking the satirical bite of the first Scream this is mere pastiche that doesn't even wink at what it is pointlessly xeroxing from the past
The film might not host an original concept but its attention to detail - the tiny things that made 's slashers unique - render Hatchet a far more enjoyable experience than its competition
Feels like an old-school slasher flick that's been hidden on a dusty shelf for the past twenty years And yes I mean that as a compliment
An uneven occasionally vivid ultimately unsatisfactory treatment of themes that should've packed more punch
The cult becomes the most important character in this otherwise well-made Canadian film about a charismatic group leader and his followers Catch star Ellen Page so you can say you knew her when
An anti-cult cautionary tale directed at impressionable kids in jeopardy of joining shirtless hunks on European excursions marked by chanting eating out of dumpsters and psychological warfare
Page has the looks and the internal landscape to provide an awkward plot with the emotional hook to hang on to This supernova in the making can carry a movie
About willfully homeless street youth and their programmed need for community and belonging but the film's unintentional ramifications dig deeper
Worth seeing even if only for Ellen Page's stunning performance
The whole is never quite convincing
Wightman's gradual change from liberated mom to moonie is one of the scariest performances of the year
Like the homeless kids at its center Alison Murray's feature debut is passionate angry and suffering from a serious lack of discipline
A clear-eyed look at the pleasures and price of abandoning conventional mores for experimental lifestyles
so threadbare in offering character motivations and background that it hobbles the performances
Alison Murray's chaotic semiautobiographical account of a teenage girl's misadventures in a traveling cult occupies its own stylistic niche the movie as acid flashback
For all the flaws its grit and honesty have genuine strength
Though Mouth to Mouth is a grim movie it's far from a hopeless one
Despite its contemporary stylistic flourishes including several disparate dance sequences choreographed by director Alison Murray previously a music video helmer Mouth to Mouth is pretty ordinary
Suffers from disjointed storytelling and myriad other problems including a bizarre reliance on modern dance sequences to interrupt the action
Murray making her feature debut as a writer and director left home when she was  and her firsthand experience with hard truths gives the movie a raw authority
Murray becomes less and less sure of where things are heading or what it is she is trying to get at such that the last few reels feel perfunctory and unengaged
The film's subject matter is far from enjoyable and in the absence of anything fresh in its perspective it's hard to imagine who would want to endure it
A gritty original and visceral film about a cult's romantic hold on a vulnerable girl
Cruising can now be ranked among Friedkin's very best films
Its gamy images inside the leather and SM gay bars along the Greenwich Village waterfront are both busy and dark
The movie merits viewing consideration
Is it offensive Yes and no It's insensitive certainly And I wouldn't want my mother watching it lest she think I've been in a sling in the meatpacking district for most of my adult life
Was it insensitive to make this film when it stood to represent the gay subculture to mainstream America Yes Is it a great film No But it is a fascinating relic
The film comes off as little more than a sensationalized exploitation flick
A lot of upcoming filmmakers saw Cruising and took notes because the movie became the prototype for every serial killer movie to follow see Seen Basic Instinct etc
still unsettling even after far more explicit fare has been produced in recent years
Taking away the kissing caressing and a few bloody killings Friedkin has no story though picture pretends to be a murder mystery combined with a study of Al Pacino's psychological degradation
Friedkin makes the kind of films that a pod from Invasion of the Body Snatchers might make given the chance
Is it possible that Cruising is everything its detractors and defenders say it is
What an odd relic of the s Cruising is Controversial enough at the time to derail director William Friedkin's career thirty years later it's considered totally benign when a Disney star films a reconstruction of its X-rated scenes
Viewers are spared nothing as Steve Burns undergoes degrading brutality after brutality virtually nobody is portrayed sympathetically
What's left is the framework for a graphic brutal sickening film without the violent effects that might have made sense however illegitimate out of the conception
Cruising is no lost classic but the critical shoeing doesn't square with Friedkin's intelligence and steady sparse technique
While the savagery of the murders and the explicitness of the sexual practices on display are initially unsettling they soon become numbing and ultimately yawn-inducing
Appropriately framed by opening and closing shots of a garbage scow Cruising is trash
This detective melodrama has something to offend almost everyone
What we're left with is a movie without the courage to declare itself
It's certainly not the grotesque failure of art and morality described in  But a failure nonetheless
The information in the film is frightening to say the least but as a documentary the film has serious flaws
There's plenty of disquieting material here but I wish the film were less antagonistic in its own right
What makes this movie worth seeing is ironically exactly what may deter potential audiences It's a rigorous almost academic examination of a venomous hatred rooted in the past primed to poison the future
a profoundly disturbing -- and depressing -- look at the New Anti-Semitism of the post- world
Ever Again is laudable in its intent but less than impressive in its execution
Director writer and co-producer Richard Trank packages an alarming report with abundant news clips quotes and interviews
Credit Ever Again with accomplishing a mission that one would hope had become superfluous by now delineating a vehement anti-Semitism that can be found on the far right and the far left -- and that by no means confines itself to Germany
Chilling
Capably narrated by Kevin Costner Ever Again is a mixed bag briskly edited good-looking but suspect in some of its logic
While the movie does raise awareness it also relies on fear-mongering tactics see title rather than cohesive argument to foment outrage
Richard Trank's short documentary focuses on the rise of anti-Semitism among Muslims and neo-Nazis in Europe
The film succeeds in making the case that the hatred that seemed dead and buried  years ago is alive and growing and beginning to present itself once again as a threat to humane civilization
This documentary by an arm of the Simon Wiesenthal Center seeks to stir up outrage about recent bursts of anti-Semitism in Europe
It has a sketchy quality that will prove unsatisfying to those looking for something a bit thematically deeper than a simple warning bulletin
A well-balanced primer on the Arab-Israeli conflict Blood and Tears takes just over an hour to go from the roots of Zionism to the recent electoral victory of Hamas
'A small house can accommodate hundreds of friends but can't accommodate two enemies' the doctor says ruefully quoting an Arab proverb Sadly Blood and Tears is the proof
Unless you've thrown up your hands and butted out of all news of the Middle East debacle nothing in this methodical unimaginative documentary about the Arab-Israeli conflict will surprise edify or God forbid outrage you
Nothing more than a collection of sound bytes most of them biased many of them inflammatory by a variety of speakers It is hard to know what good this does
As the film progresses it becomes increasingly bold in taking sides while all the time pretending to be unbiased
Though refreshingly reluctant to take sides regarding geography of the matter the film has a subtle slant toward peace
Packing quite a bit of wit wisdom craziness and creativity into its slick-looking and efficient frame Bickford Schmeckler's Cool Ideas is a bizarrely charming little diversion
Bickford is an assured first feature for former Beacon Pictures exec Lew with a winning cast and an infectious spirit
The film's early momentum wears off and we realize the movie's not as amusing or entertaining as it wants to be
Director Scott Lew is not without his own cool ideas having Reno 's Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon play campus cops is genius but his focus is all over the place
What should be the American Pie of college genius comedies suffers from a lack of imagination and an absence of impudence
It's the sort of small-scale comedy that invites multiple viewings
A psychological thriller that establishes interesting situations only to lose its sense of direction
This  debut feature by husband-and-wife team Kim Roberts and Eli Despres is pretty involving though they strain to develop the girls' relationship problems amid all the suspense and the plot grows increasingly unlikely
Co-directors and co-writers Eli B Despres and Kim Roberts make their feature debut with an uneven teens-in-peril thriller
You won't jump out of your seat or grab your neighbor on this one But you're likely to leave mildly intrigued with a little something to think about
Like many a horror movie the unfolding drama has moments that test credulity Yet writer-directors Eli Despres and Kim Roberts' teasing of genres and handling of actors also hints at psychologically insightful films to come
Credit is definitely due to writerdirectors Kim Roberts and Eli Despres for trying to come up with something a little brainier than three chicks get killed in a cabin
it's hard to warm to characters this flawed without some humorous leavening The result is dreary particularly at slightly more than two hours
By the time these two must decide whether or not to stay together we've given up on the whole process entirely
Sometimes a movie improves on second viewing and I liked Flannel Pajamas better when I screened it again
It's as close to what the disintegration of a real-life relationship looks like as you'll ever see onscreen
Star Julianne Nicholson does remarkable work in an unsympathetic role helped by director Jeff Lipsky's fine control of his characters
With Flannel Pajamas Lipsky has written an excellent off-Broadway play not a film
Kirk and Nicholson provide solid acting throughout the movie Lipsky's writing is frequently original However the overall sense of this film is that it lacks credibility
Both Nicholson and Kirk are terrific actors but the script limits them and their performances
Writerdirector Lipsky has something to say about the impossibility of human beings to love each other but his language is that of an amateur playwright who does not know when he is only repeating cliches
This is the kind of introspective drama in which a determined pair of young very fine actors and a strong filmmaker put everything on the line to explore emotional truth wherever it exists
It's a harsh look at a love that seems good until it isn't any more and frankly I got tired of both of these people long before they got tired of each other
Maybe Lipsky's been too direct in his screenplay he makes us feel like informed witnesses to their relationship rather than participants Which means we spend most of the movie thinking just break up already please
This is all quite fascinating
Flannel Pajamas is a sharply observed dissection of a couple's relationship from blind date to marriage to difficulties over everything from whether to get a dog to when to have a baby
In his sophomore feature Lipsky doesn't feel the need to pump the movie with showy visual tricks You don't even know he's there most of the time which is probably a compliment
Better to rent Scenes From a Marriage Manhattan or My Dinner With Andre and stay home -- flannel pajamas optional
Flannel Pajamas is so gorged with gab it feels like a filibuster
The incisive moments of recognizable humanity though are outnumbered by those of awkward obviousness
They ought to have cut both the film and the marriage a little shorter
Twenty minutes or so of cuts would probably have helped the movie pack a more potent punch
This latest DCOM hit is a puddle of boring clichs and too-familiar situations
It's movies like Jump In that make me appreciate Dodgeball all the more
quickly sinks underneath the weight of its heavy-handed predictable and flat-out ridiculous storyline
You've gotta hand it to the Disney Channel They sure know how to inspire their audience
The  to -year old audience for whom this urban melodrama is intended won't be put off by the youthful cast's limited acting range phony boxing choreography and the wavery storyline
Disney ropes in an energetic winner for families
Kubrick stumbles around with eyes wide shut
If you're a fan of Stanley Kubrick or just a die-hard film buff you may find this weird semi-documentary an absolute hoot I did
It's no 'Six Degrees of Separation' but Malkovich charms the audience as much as his marks making this solid sit-com entertainment
A loopy larkthe sheer goofiness of the premise together with its gossipy 'insider' nature and the take-no-prisoners performance of John Malkovichcarry it along
John Malkovich has a blast so will you
Even if the film is essentially a one-man show a one-man show starring John Malkovich is bound to be really damn good
Fans of John Malkovich will most appreciate Colour Me Kubrick For the rest this is an amusing little blip on the movie radar screen
Director Brian W Cook should know that hopes are seldom high for movies that debut on DVD the same day they hit the multiplex
It's an impressive moving wax museum certainly but even metatextual follies eventually need a pulse
At best a kitschy Catch Me If You Can and at worst a tedious comedy
It literally only has one idea in its head and when that idea runs dry it's as lost as Conway is without his plethora of Kubrick masks
This is a kicky little movie
A little bit like a coloring book -- flip the pages and each is pretty much like the one before escalating variations on the same scam with Malkovich filling in the cartoonish shadings and occasionally going way outside the lines
The irony of Color Me Kubrick is that the visual tricks merely serve as a backdrop for Malkovich's inspired high-wire performance
Not only is there nothing there the nothingness is a complete bore When a film's highpoint is a soundtrack that relies heavily on other soundtracks you've got problems
Conway looked and sounded nothing like Kubrick and didn't even research his supposed identity He's clearly a fascinating character who deserves a better movie
Malkovich captures not only the nuttiness of Conway with his smorgasbord of foreign-sounding accents but also his pathos
Any picture featuring a sped-up version of the William Tell Overture is so drunk on its own whimsy that it most likely sucks with a dedicated vigour
It's simply not a movie not as it stands It's a five-minute demo reel stretched to feature length
Colour Me Kubrick is a marginal curiosity that survives on a whiff of appropriation
Ultimately Fast Food Nation is preaching to the converted
This movie has taken a firebrand book and turned it into a whingeing piece of defeatism
Engaging and stimulating
Intelligent and radical this meaty expos of corporate greed offers plenty to chew on
It's a bit of a McMovie
This is a must
The stories lack shape and the procession of famous faces detracts from the low-key realist tone
Certainly food for thought then just a shame the characters aren't as fully-fleshed
Though it may well make you vow never to eat a burger again the film never really holds itself together
The large cast is uniformly excellent and the film has been designed to stir the pot  Unfortunately audiences don't seem to be responding Global warming is the hot button issue but our food supply and its contamination is just as important
Fills us with too much stuffing to digest in one sitting
This was never intended to be a conventional movie but more like a personal industrial film illustrating the process that brings the corpse of a cow to your dinner table
preachy
Avril Lavigne even pops up to rail against deforestation Who knew she could pronounce it
Alt-weekly defeatism
'Fast Food Nation' might have translated into a compelling documentary Instead Schlosser's research is used as a springboard into a sluggish fictional narrative that merely hints at the grim reality
Distills a non-fiction book about the influence of fast food on the global cultural landscape into a narrative film that touches on the many of the points and populaces of the book
It's about empty calories and empty life - ridiculous insistences that all kids see playing time regardless of on-field performance the absurdity of porn as background noise that revolution can start in rec rooms and the woozy lure of neon strip malls
Linklater is preaching to the converted
This is a considered film that lacks the immediacy of a blunt message like the more simplistic Super Size Me or the punchy smokescreen climax of a film like Syriana to send the audience out feeling enlightened
A transitional time in the life of a -year-old ad agency executive when he has a chance to take a hard look at his life
Lebanon Pa is a few strong moments of storytelling lost in a sea of indie cliche
A poignant portrait of an unlikely friendship and a pungent contrast of urban clamor and small-town murmur
Lebanon PA is a beautiful film with powerful characters and a story you can really connect with in a way that won't make you feel gross or manipulated
Lebanon Pa begins as a tale about male middle-aged self-discovery but soon becomes something quite different a clear-eyed if crassly manipulative take on the culture wars
The real casualties are momentum and narrative cohesion
For the most part it's your classic character-driven movie - the antithesis of an issue drama - until a contentious issue surfaces that threatens to overwhelm the story
Displays the delicate touch of a sledgehammer on an old sidewalk
Kitson who plays CJ the mouthy forthright teenager at the center of the storm illuminates a movie that is otherwise so studiously balanced an examination of teenage pregnancy that it deserves a medal for evenhandedness
Plays out like one of those dull message movies that TV networks used to crank out almost weekly but the earnestness is at times almost appealingly old-fashioned
As long as the pic remains rooted in a specific locale's rhythms it imparts a sense of discovery but when local color wears thin bald ideological small-townbig-city oppositions intrude
This is a plea for self-described indie filmmakers to stop utilizing hyper-polished technique to talk about human misery
Not perfect but vastly superior to most of the Hollywood dreck we've been getting lately Lebanon Pa is a thoughtful and perceptive film well worth recommending
An intriguing beautiful film by a promising young director
Since the crux of the tale is a teenager's decision about an unwanted pregnancy Lebanon Pa can't possibly please everyone But Hickernell doesn't strain to be provocative
Starts off like a self-serious Garden State and ends up like a self-serious Juno
Pity there was no room for Phyllis Diller or Carol Channing here because then the film might have had a leg up on Scooby-Doo and the Creepy Castle
A perfectly respectable second entry in the saga of gay private eye Donald Strachey
director Ron Oliver applies a thin veneer of straight-to-cable pseudo-gloss without finding a workable tone and the cast lacks the charisma and chemistry to make the genre and gender-bending register as more than novelty
Where film noir is often punch-drunk with a jab of snappy patter and a left hook of world-weary cynicism Shock tries to clinch with understanding
Were it not for the fact that the hero and many of the major supporting characters are gay this breezy disposable film could as easily have been a mainstream network pilot for a McMillan and Wife-style series
This is a sly refreshingly grown-up gay entertainment though rather less satisfying as a thriller
It's certainly a pleasant enough way to kill  minutes
While the idea would certainly seem to hold promise for interesting social commentary the script by Ron McGee lacks the necessary bite as does the rote direction of Ron Oliver
This film never risks being realistic or even comprehensible but it will pass a Sunday afternoon quite pleasantly
The movie is irritating in its refusal to make things clear if spy movies are going to work like clockwork they have to be put together with some care
The screenplay by Walter Hill has very little to do with character and motivation and everything to do with the incidents and the mechanics of the spy trade
Reasonably entertaining old-fashioned thriller
Actioner starring Paul Newman is worth seeing but marginally
There's a whole lot of nothing going on here
For the most part the film is standard fare with plot discrepancies countered by the film's atmosphere and star appeal
This is by no means a bad film but it should have been better considering the names involved
Although the movie drags Okuda who also directed makes for a gloriously bad lieutenant while Ozawa is enjoyably discomfiting in her unblushing carnality
Director and star Eiji Okuda has created almost a gentle story with definite humanity behind its intent
Shoujyo An Adolescent seems to be several movies at once a hard-boiled detective story a Lolita-style intergenerational romance and a family psychodrama complete with pat Freudian flashbacks
A dirty old man's delight
You could be forgiven for missing the thematic underpinnings amidst the long fetishized sex scenes
The film is perhaps best thought of as part cultural curiosity part obscurantist's delight
Decidedly uneven yet intriguing
To confuse this with a touching May-December romance like Lost in Translation could bring a very early end to date night
The texture and polish is deeply missed but the characters are so strong and engaging it still entertains
does not quite compare to some of Disney's finest animated work in terms of story or character but it surely holds its own in terms of artwork and sound design
While not nearly as memorable as its predecessor Brother Bear  has plenty going for it
Sequels are often disappointing but 'Brother Bear ' is a keeper mostly because of its charming story and extraordinary background music
triste constatar que a magia e a sensibilidade do primeiro filme foram substitudas por clichs uma histria ridcula e sentimentalismo barato
the return of Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis as the idiot moose is nice if not a little forced
comes off as an affable yet entirely needless piece of work
It's just a neutral object with bears
A tale well told a look at history in the making and those being shaken in the process
The final collaboration between Ismail Merchant and James Ivory The White Countess isn't their absolute best effort but as swan songs go it's still a sight more auspicious than the last-ever Simpson-Bruckheimer picture
The symbolism of the situation -- a blind diplomat trying and once again failing to stage-manage international harmony -- seems like something from a socially conscious play of the s
It's a pretty journey even if it is far too talky and emotionally distant to really work
Merchant Ivory places its final famous imprimatur on a worthy film
By sheer willpower and some of the best art direction of this year or any other this is a fitting poetic epitaph to the life and career of Ismail Merchant
A worthy final collaboration from James Ivory and his late partner Ismail Merchant
The White Countess is the last Merchant-Ivory and embodies most of the virtues of the brand
A little too emotionally repressed to suit its melodrama -- imagine Casablanca with Paul Henried miscast in the Bogart role
James Ivory would have done well to take his from Casablanca since that similarly themed film achieves everything that this film aspires to but ultimately fails at
A little judicious editing might have made it more effective
A beautiful movie with an intriguing central theme and cast that is far easier to admire than to actually like
A middling example of the sort of tony projects upon which Merchant and Ivory built their reputations
One of the great partnerships in movies ends not with a bang or even a whimper but with a stifled yawn
Though Merchant-Ivory hadn't made a first-rate film since The Remains of the Day in  there was always a chance they'd hit one last pitch out of the park The White Countess their final pairing is just a bloop single
It has an emotional payoff It isn't much but by Merchant-Ivory standards it is an orgasm of raw emotion
James Ivory has cast Britain's acting aristocracy to play post-Revolution Russian aristocracy which brings much gravitas and many subtle performance highs to this drawn out story set in  Shanghai
Esteticamente impecvel como todas as produes Merchant Ivory o filme falha do ponto de vista narrativo revelando-se como seus personagens excessivamente frio e emocionalmente distante
Ivory takes a tired clich-ridden nostalgic screenplay by Kazuo Ishiguro and layers on the ennui
While a beautiful and moving film The White Countess sadly falls short of being a great one because it never allows us into the hearts of its primary protagonists
Where does one go to find all of these bizarre folks Filmmaker Michael Ferris Gibson didn't have to look much further than Criagslistorg
A fun and free-form celebration of the site's communal spirit and only-in-San Francisco ethos
As a way of saying 'people sure are wacky' Gibson's movie succeeds although it goes on a bit long
A diverting infomercial
The disorganized documentary  Hours on Craigslist is primarily a stroll through human desire as manifested on the popular Internet site Craigslistorg
Personalities are as engaging as they are diverse while zippy well-photographed package is never dull
It plays too much like a paid ad Everybody interviewed had a positive experience But what about those who didn't
I can't imagine  Hours on Google being any more or less compelling
Intermittently amusing rarely illuminating and ultimately tedious documentary
The flick itself gets a B- but the DVD is grade-A impressive all the way
A surprisingly wise mature and difficult look at psychiatric ethics and the inherent problems of dating outside one's age bracket
Prime is as dead as any body at the morgue
Abrahams and Streep simply steal a movie dominated by two less interesting characters
boasts a strong cast but sticks it in too many contrived sitcom scenarios that detract from much of the emotional impact
yet another film that screams 'Wait for the video release'
The odd thing about Prime is that the film is so neatly constructed and the story so engaging I have little to say besides please go see it
The highlight of this complex love story is the moment when Meryl Streep's conservative therapist realises that the intimate details her vulnerable patient Uma Thurman is sharing with her are actually about her own son
Never really rises above comedic fluff no matter how introspective or bittersweet it becomes
It's pretentiously clever premise executed in a very conventional and ultimately dull manner Prime is an intended heartbreaker that in execution is an extended flatline
A solid romantic comedy that benefits from its ambition to look at the importance of age and religious differences even if it could have gone deeper
All of Prime is ripe for the kind of discovery that comes with seeing it on a video store shelf after either passing it a few times or not finding what you wanted the first time
mature and surprisingly thoughtful
Prime is an enjoyable romcom it's sharply observed and has some interesting things to say about relationships Worth seeing
You'd getgive a second date after this one Probably
Meryl Streep brilla en esta comedia romntica graciosa y disfrutable sobre el amor los prejuicios y otras costumbres muy humanas
Ironically this therapeutic romantic comedy ultimately suffers from too many unexplored issues
Not very funny I didn't like it
Really is nice often charming occasionally funny
Prime is an above average romantic comedy that still doesn't quite make the grade
Like most relationship films it has a tendency to self-indulgence Prime is less about relationships than it is about life lessons - a funny bittersweet one but that is unfortunately what a lot of relationships turn out to be
More like a very special episode of Oprah than a night out at the movies
This isn't a bad movie it's just watered down
Typical of the sort of melodrama that's the stuff of well-meaning telefilms butplayed at too high-pitched a tone
Good intentions Wish it were a better movie
Unlike many films with Christian agendas this one doesn't sweep ugliness under the rug
It offers a compelling portrait of human tragedy and the journey to redemption
For all the tough-minded talk and frank portraits of inner-city life the film is not altogether convincing
Woman boasts an unexpected edginess as well as a terrific performance from Kimberly Elise
It is more a public service announcement than a movie but it has to be more useful to its audience than a summer blockbuster offering Halle Berry's tips on how to use a bullwhip
There is little to like about many of the hard characters we meet Yet the film has a core generosity
The talented players work hard to sell it but all too often Woman is over-intellectualized and self-consciously arty
A case of preaching to the choir
As a film it plays like a heavy-handed morality tale one might come across on a middling cable network
A monochromatic melodrama
while director Michael Schultz's work is unsubtleit's guaranteed to find a sympathetic audience much in the same way Jakes' plainspoken sermons connect with his followers
A very interesting if not always successful drama that is also part revivalist sermon
It sounds like a rather overt Christian message but the film is actually more of a cautionary melodrama with religious sermons sprinkled in between the various scenes
As with a good sermon it is engaging and strives to inspire and provide food for thought Audiences going in knowing what to expect shouldn't be disappointed
an enjoyable and competently made film that will appeal to secular-minded moviegoers as well as the choir
The film raises the questions it hopes churches will answer It's clearly designed to open discussion on these questions and to encourage churches to discuss sexual abuse
Full of pretty pictures and soaring music but shy on substance
Though America's Heart  Soul doesn't break new ground its apolitical tone and diverse cast may be a tonic for those tired of our country's divisive climate
Harbors some indelibly arresting images and characters whose stories even at their most superficial manage to be authentically inspiring
Even though at times Schwartzberg's documentary exalts the American way of life with the mythical reverence of a Leni Riefenstahl the experience is undeniably stirring
You'll laugh cry feel inspired by these Americans from every corner
After a while America's Heart  Soul turns into an offensive parade of smiling poor people
If you need a break from all the chatter about Iraq and Michael Moore's latest film give America's Heart and Soul a try
A clip package of interesting snapshots of landscapes and people whirled by fast enough to look like something meaningful but essentially no more interesting that a neighbor's vacation video
Singing a few rounds of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' is much more stirring and doesn't take nearly as long
We watch movies every day that celebrate violence sex and crude humor Now here's the chance to watch a movie that powerfully presents something worth celebrating us
A place where nobody watches TV criminals are rehabilitated and everyone's life has meaning
Less evocative and honest in all its  minutes than say just one of the throwaway establishing shots of Angela Arenivar's dusty Texas-panhandle hometown in last year's Spellbound a true American movie with a lot more heart and soul
In this film even homeless people have something positive to say about the country
An inspirational and emotionally effective feel-good film
For an episodic film America's Heart and Soul is fast-paced and often downright exciting
Even if Schwartzberg's choices feel somewhat clichd there's no doubting the spirit of his subjects who seem genuinely proud to share their thoughts and feelings for a few too brief moments
a mixture of laughter awe admiration and poignancy
a whirlwind tour of the nation through the romantic colorful gravity-defying cinematography of director Louis Schwartzberg
Forget reality television This is reality and it's all about people who don't need a head shot to validate their existence
A big beautiful love letter to America
More a collage than a movie
Intelligent and original
It's hard to root for people who defy oppressive social systems when they can't seem to make sound decisions on their own
Cinematography production design and music are all top-notch but the film largely succeeds because of the leads -- two fine actors at the top of their game
May be one of the most perfect cyberpunk films ever made
Winterbottom's sci-fi romance is in a class of its own Robbins and Morton are clearly in their element here
It's too bleak for the morose Robbins and doe-eyed Morton to connect meaningfully with each other or with us
Too much stoicism and not enough vulnerability -- OK for a futuristic film about a dystopian society but not if you're supposed to feel the emotions of the main characters
Original intelligent cool aloof and ultimately unforgettable
a noir snore with no moral desperation no clear-cut point-of-view and a love story whose eroticism feels about as urgent as yardwork
Part thriller part love story and part political allegory told as dream noir but too tangled and slippery to inspire much empathy
The film is like bypass surgery clinically precise but always in control of your heart
Amid the white walls and slick surfaces of this film the characters seem more like lab rats than human beings
Achingly elegiac sci-fi story of love and memory lost - an Oedipal tragedy for the genetically modified age
The premise was sounder than the execution
A luxurious sight to behold
Satisfyingly cinematic
What keeps Code  from living up to its fascinating premise is the lack of empathy we feel for William and Maria They are almost like benign video game characters
Disappointing sci-fi that's too intense for kids
a visually striking but emotionally flat mash-up of romantic drama film noir and science fiction that sounds much more interesting than it turns out to be
There's lots of activity and energy but no joy nor sense of spontaneity
I wouldn't even mind watching it more than once which is the true test
An artificially flavored movie potionaudiences may be less than enchanted with the gobbledygook results
if they ruinedas badly as they ruined Ella Enchanted then we're going to have to start a revolution or something
There's enough attitude here to keep the audience laughing even when the film tips into stupid spoofery
Wonderfully sweet and thoroughly enjoyable it's like a live-action Shrek
It's sweet it's quirky and the whole family can fall under its spell
An overcalculated fusion of Shrek and The Princess Bride with all the smarts replaced by smartass
Looks an awful lot like Shrek down to the funky closing dance sequence
It looks tiring for a movie to flaunt its sense of irony as eagerly as Ella Enchanted while remaining so naive
Someone should tell O'Haver and the gaggle of writers it took to write this unenchanted mess that updated doesn't have to mean washed-up and dumbed-down
A sweet little anachronistic musical fairy tale along the lines of 'Shrek'
A thoroughly charming performer with a bracing freshness about her that carries the film Hathaway establishes credible chemistry with Brit thesp Dancy
Mesmo pecando por ser convencional demais este  um filme charmoso e bem-intencionado - e certamente far grande sucesso entre as crianas
'El pblico seguramente quedar encantado por la inocencia el humor y la magia de una pelcula a la que seguramente el tiempo dar el lugar que merece'
The idea of mixing the modern with the medieval is a dubious Mulligan's stew -- and annoys quickly
Avoids a misstep common among girl-empowerment flicks which often emasculate the male lead to make the heroine truly heroic manages to make both leads appealing
The Narrator begins and ends the story talking about how fairy tales transport us to another place but the sad fact is that Ella lets us stay right where we are
Anne Hathaway is the cheery spark in this glitzy girl's fantasy story from screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith Legally Blonde
Endearing enduring with just a few bits of crude humor
As I write this review I find myself growing nostalgic for the film I want to walk away from my computer and see it again right now It's just that good
Likeable nostalgic movie that walks a smooth tightrope between a coming-of-age tale and a dark long-forgotten Twilight Zone episode
The movie is light years behind the touching celebration of youth found in Stand By Me
I will not deny that it left me with a very nice feeling throughout
The elegiac reflective mood is treated almost incidentally letting it earn a reaction naturally
minor shortcomings come in its overused setting slightly lackadaisical pace and mildly unresolved conclusion small matters if the movie puts you under its spell
Una cinta tierna y emocionante por momentospero no termina por convencer
feels a bit pre-fabricated although William Goldman's screenplay sets up intriguing offbeat relationships between Bobby and Ted and Bobby and Elizabeth
It could have been something special instead it is run-of-the-mill
This movie invokes a sense of nostalgia and a yearning for those childhood friends who as we grow older may be forgotten but will never be replaced
Hopkins continues to turn in one lackluster performance after another
While this film has the potential to be either a heartwarming coming-of-age story or a tense psychological thriller it doesn't really achieve either goal
You'll still come away from Hearts in Atlantis wanting to read the book but had Hicks and Goldman got it right you would've run straight from the cinema to buy it
The film has a lot of nice little touches going for it and while there are the obligatory moments of heartstring plucking underscored by the stir of violins it never really overdoes things The only problem is it's just been so done already
Hearts in Atlantis is a leap of faith with nothing on the other side
If good cinematographers are 'panning for gold' with their camera lens Sobocinski has put his pan in the river and come back with a fortune
Hicks' film is a beautiful trifle a neat trick of light and sound to coax empathy
What happened to the prodigious vitality of Scott Hicks Shine His third feature sugffers from the same stifling artistic treatment that his second did and this one is based on stories by Stephen King
A movie that says we might as well pack it in as soon as we turn  is more bitter than bittersweet
Above average coming of age story
An enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences The Chteau is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten
Has the gritty look of a Dogma film which shows what the movement's influence has been reduced to a trendy look not a set of principles for honest no-frills filmmaking
Ze movie starts out so funny then she is nothing
Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very very slowly
a fluffy flaky croissant of a culture clash comedy barely substantial enough for a feature but just light and tasty enough to satisfy
Thanks to The Chteau's balance of whimsicality narrative discipline and serious improvisation almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises
A culture-clash comedy that in addition to being very funny captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling American in Europe
'The Chteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot'
A culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is
It's a likeable piece and a prime audition reel for both Rudd and Malco
Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises
Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece the picture begins to resemble the shapeless grasping actors' workshop that it is
The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them
Funny even after it has run out of ideas
Has an improvisational feel and a cheesy shot-on-video look why do that when you've got the French countryside as subject but that first hour is still worth seeing
There's a spontaneity to The Chateau a sense of light-heartedness that makes it attractive throughout
The new faces are interesting but the old story isn't especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted
There are enough of the usual only-in-the-movies misunderstandings between Graham and Allen to delay any sort of resolution but director Jesse Peretz neglects to fill the gaps with any memorably diverting action
Once the viewer accepts the huge leaps of faith required in the film's premise it's a lot of fun to strap oneself in and enjoy this goofy ride
Unfunny from beginning to even after the end
A limp wet noodle of a movie
Mangold should have done a bit more research with the screenplay not to mention metaphysics
Yes it's sweet and enjoyable but it's also a bit plodding
I was quickly won over by its disarming sense of fun great performances and some clever ideas smoothly executed
One of the better examples of romantic comedies doing the rounds and even though it is overlong at times it will make for passable video fodder one dreary Sunday evening
Jackman is handsome funny rugged and refined he gleams with confidence in a part that could have reduced lesser actors to silliness
If the idea is not original well not much is these days be thankful for something that can be called amusing
An average workmanlike production virtually indistinguishable from any other example of the pat easily digested box-office-successful formula faithfully churned out by Hollywood every day of the year
There's nothing terribly wrong with Kate  Leopold -- it's just an awfully conventional upmarket romantic comedy
In establishing such a lofty pretence as time travel Mangold then trots out an uninspiring love story which fails to play-up the cultural differences between characters
Mesmo sendo um pouco mais longo do que deveria o filme conta uma historinha simples mas agradvel - e se beneficia enormemente do carisma de Hugh Jackman como um dos personagens-ttulo
The two individually likable stars do eventually reach some level of warmth but by that time the film is nearly over and Kate and Leopold are supposed to be madly in love with each other
Jackman commands Kate and Leopold as no actor has commanded a romantic comedy since Steve Martin in Roxanne
Ironically what jeopardises the transaction is Ryan
Despite a promising premise Jackman's Golden Globe-nominated performance remains the only tangible reason to see this movie
Surprisingly effective romantic comedy with Hugh Jackman at his most charming and Meg Ryan proving yet again why she has become the watermark against which all other female romantic leads are compared
A time-travel romantic comedy whose best elements -- Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman -- overcome distracting plot holes loose threads and assorted contrivances to make for a mostly charming and diverting tale
Some nice moments but overall not a total success
It's rare to come across a time travel tale as listless as this one
Kate  Leopold caters to a modern nostalgia for the good old days and while it does critique the commodification of the past somewhat the film ultimately falls prey to it too
Milking a Brontosaurus would be easier than milking this franchise any more    This pointless sequel is a tepid end if there is a God to the series
For a sequel with a Roman numeral in the title Jurassic Park III is more entertaining than expected
If you're looking for a tight script interesting three-dimensional characters and something new with this movie you will be disappointed
It's not art  it's entertainment and it knows it Boy does it entertain
Jurassic Park III is a blunder
It might as well be the crappy pilot for a Jurassic Park TV series or a feature version of Sid and Marty Krofft's Land of the Lost
True the film offers little new but it's still stirring family entertainment
As seqncias de ao so boas mas no o bastante para que ignoremos a fragilidade do roteiro com seus pssimos dilogos e os personagens esquemticos
Much darker than the previous films this third installment feels more like a horror flick set in amusement park than a good sci-fi adventure though special effects due to technology advances are more sophisticated
Mr Johnston keeps the action and one-liners coming and before you know it it's over
Spectacular but not scary or thrilling
An efficient and surprisingly palatable finale to the Jurassic franchise
An all-action helter-skelter don't-forget-to-buy-the-computer-game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking
A clumsy and poorly written farce with irritating characters I prayed for imminent death to arrive to
For kids who can handle nonstop action it's good scary fun
More than half an hour shorter than The Lost World so at least there's a lot less of it to suffer through
The wonder of the first movie is long gone but a few thrills still remain
A marked improvement over its immediate predecessor this film works as a fast and efficient thriller that offers a few great surprises along the way
Jurassic Park III is cynically amusing not least when it takes digs at the previous films and most surprising of all it actually may leave you wanting more
Jurassic Park III ultimately falls right in line with its immediate predecessor
The signature zaniness is missing from director Michael Corrente's adaptation
Mean-spirited ugly and just not funny
Ever hear someone tell supposedly amusing tales of their childhood and adolescence that seem only to hold the slightest bit of interest to the person telling the story
It comes to the 'startling' conclusion that rich kids might do the same bad things working-class kids do but get away with it because their money gives them privileges
I like it just about as much as I didn't
Isn't worth your time
Badly written and severely miscast
Michael Corrente loses his bearings bringing nothing fresh and everything bland
The movie reeks of the kind of atmosphere that makes you reach for the Lysol
A film sort-of from the Farrelly brothers with practically none of its charm
Nothing absolutely nothing is original in this movie
Alec Baldwin is the least convincing blue - collar - poker - playing - whisky - swilling yahoo to hit the screen in many a year
Fitfully amusing but nothing remarkable
Outside Providence is the kind of film that  minutes after the closing credits roll you can't help forgetting
I must admit I didn't hear every word Some were muffled by my groans
Outside Providence shows us nothing we haven't seen before
I wish I had been outside of Providence instead of watching this mess
A funny and sometimes poignant coming-of-age drama
the performances and the genuinely interesting script make this one worth checking out
The first shot is pure Farrelly but the rest of the movie doesn't match its humor
An atmospheric fairytale romp across the landscapes of Tolkien's imagination
The hobbits all look like Joey Lawrence -- what's up with that
a noble effort original in concept if disappointing in execution
A showcase for inspired imagery and sheer strangeness a near-miss magnum opus from another era before the cult of Tolkien went Hollywood
It is here we see Bakshi jump the shark
At its best Bakshi's visualization of Tolkien's world can be startlingly effective Tolkien fans will appreciate what Bakshi managed to get right
Falls far short of the charm and sweep of the original story
The film is visually compelling even when murk overtakes the narrative
Bakshi's version using animation and live-action tracings is uniformly excellent sticking closely to the original text and visually echoing many of Tolkien's own drawings
in retrospect it feels like an elegant appropriately sized adaptation - with some beautiful animation work
dark and fantastical with a mature approach rare in animated films of its day and Bakshi's rotoscope process creates an unusually fluid and expressive style
The live action version trumps it in every conceivable way there simply is no comparison And yet Middle Earth is still better off for its presence
Quite simply those who do not know the characters of Middle Earth going in will not know them coming out
Animated adventure too dated and dark for younger kids
A contemporary viewing of The Lord of the Rings is an exercise in outlandishness as well as nostalgia dreamlike peculiar
It's a reckless film blitzing through some plot points and stalling out over others the lack of a particular rhythm does not do it any favors and it is certainly not a fast  minutes
It looked terrible then and it still does cartoon characters move differently from live actors and the attempt to duplicate natural movement ends in stylistic incoherence
What most people remember is the mix of the live-action tracing within the traditional animation and just how effectively creepy it managed to be but for the time this did a pretty good job of adapting the dense novels
Innovative and beautiful cheesy and disjointed
Tolkien fans who are familiar with novels will find it enjoyble while others may be confused by the action
Everything that is good about Summer of Sam is also bad because Lee pushes every good impulse he has into overdrive
A sprawling brilliantly acted character study which touches on love friendship and betrayal while also managing to recreate the last days of disco without a note of self-parody
A riveting and unsettling look at the summer of  when fear and paranoia reigned
The disappointment with Summer of Sam is not that it's exploitative it's just difficult to figure out what it's supposed to be about
It's easily Lee's most accomplished and satisfying movie since Malcolm X
Both beguiling and confounding an enigmatic blend of banality and brilliance that ultimately manages to overcome its myriad shortcomings through nothing but the sheer force of Lee's visionary direction
tremendous haunting multi-textured
An intelligent compassionate adult story told to thrilling fearsome effect
The cast sizzles
Spike Lee's most ambitious movie is joltingly inspired at times It's also offensively redundant and needs editing
Disappointing
The story makes very important points and shows us a graphic parable of the wages of sin But the ugliness along the way will be too much for some viewers
Lee does capture the terror a serial killer can wreak upon the community but his concentration on the weak characters hurts in the long run
Whatever you think of Spike Lee when he has the faith in his talent and material and is able to be political without the dogma he's one of the best filmmakers to come out of America in the 's
I needed stronger and more balanced characters to really care what happened
Trouble is the overlong narrative however entertaining from minute to minute is a mess
This is trashy exploitation at its clumsiest Once more a Spike Lee movie has been undone by the earnestness of being important
The film is sloppy and ill-formed its tone lurching drunkenly from turgid soap opera to soft-core porn descending at times to low camp
Like most of Lee's work this bites off more than it can chew but the breadth and energy are impressive
This ultimately disappoints but it is good to see Lee branch out into subjects which don't immediately lend themselves to his single-minded politicizing
Singleton has made all the right political moves given his complicated circumstances but he hasn't really made a movie of them
It's an ambitious but unfocused effort which is admirable for its balanced perspective but leaves critical characters as mere representations of the stereotypes it seems to be challenging
Presenting problems is not the same as dramatizing them successfully and as strong as his message is Singleton has not found the best way to deliver it
Higher Learning is often clichd unfocused and didactic But Singleton has a goal most of his contemporaries have given up on He wants to make a movie that makes a difference
The plot would all mean something if Singleton offered his characters any engaging conflicts--they all seem recycled from movies of the week
Singleton deserves praise for shining the spotlight on some of today's biggest social issues it's just unfortunate that the laws of cinema ultimately blunt some of his messages
A flawed endeavor but still an entertaining and thought-provoking film
Almost unwatchable
Everyone here from beer-swilling white fraternity boys to rap-loving black students harassed by the campus police can be judged at face value Everyone is exactly what he or she seems
Flawed but often arresting drama
John Singleton's third and best film
John Singleton at his most pretentious and preachy
Another tour-de-force for Singleton
For anyone who's been to USC it's a pretty hilarious parody of life there If you take it as presented however it's over-dramatic and unbelievable
There's some nice ideas and realistically felt characters here
A stylish intelligent film-maker Singleton interweaves the threads of his demographic tapestry with assurance passion and a welcome awareness of the complexities of the college community's contradictory impulses towards integration and separatism
Higher Learning has a great many things on its mind which immediately places it in a rather exclusive category of American films these days
Despite some likable performances Epps is especially winning the drama in Higher Learning is constricted hemmed in by Singleton's compulsion to view his characters as walking paradigms of racial and sexual politics
Singleton gets points for exposing the hypocrisy of politically correct institutions but stilted dialogue and cardboard characterizations undermine the message
The film lapses into polarized melodrama but it's a handsome piece displaying a fair understanding of our desperate need to belong
Branagh has some terrific sight gags up his sleeve and the songs themselves are absolutely wonderful
A number of the actors surprise and beguile
Might have worked a little better on stage and with a few different actors
The most exultant epiphany of romantic celebration I've seen in a film--ever
A delightful romantic comedy with musical numbers by Cole Porter Irving Berlin and George Gershwin
A masterpiece that merges the Bard's bittersweet wisdom with the wit style and idealism of 's Hollywood musicals
It's never hugely engaging and it's instantly forgettable but it has a certain goofy charm
Branagh covers all the plot points uses heroically long takes for the dance numbers and oversees an enormously talented group of designers and costumers
It's a delightful blend of past styles and songs that adds a much-needed zest to a dry and dreary movie season
Love's Labour's Lost wasn't lost on me at all if I could float into the air singing 'Cheek to Cheek' with total unabashed sincerity I probably would
Casting Silverstone as the princess gives final proof of Branagh's temporary one hopes insanity
Devices meant to keep Shakespeare user-friendly instead reduce the story to a jumble
Maybe Kenneth Branagh should have left the Hollywood musical where he found it back in the s
Branagh takes one of Shakespeare's lesser-known plays and puts his own imaginative spin on the subject
Alicia Silverstone was better as Batgirl than in this piece of garbage I don't think she even understood what she was saying
An act of double homage to antique artifice
We all know who's going to pair off with whom in the end but Branagh does get us there in some considerable style
A luscious labor of love
It may not be 'hip' but it's definitely enjoyable and it's a shame that there isn't more scope for genuine musical talents like Lester to utilise their gifts in modern cinema
A noble experiment that didn't quite work out
He didn't come from a background of training coaching and determination but from the rural hills where we see him running to school running to the water well running to the fields always with that stoic thrumming of his breath
This sweetly simple and honest documentary shouldn't be confused with a feature film
A movie which makes up for its relative deficiency of conflict and setbacks by its bold stirring meditation on the lives of people in one of the world's poorest countries
This beautiful highly stylized biographical film tells the story of Olympic gold medal winner Haile Gebrsellasie
The film leaves so many questions not only unanswered but unasked Why does Gebrselassie run What was it like for him to disobey his father and leave home to pursue his dream
As rich in anthropological detail as it is in human interest
A solid dramatized biography of Gebrselassie and much of it features the somewhat introspective runner with a sunny smile
Its mixture of biographical hype and social studies quickly curdles
If there were a cinematic dullness scale this movie would reside just one notch ahead of the rating for a blank screen
It's not suspense the film is after It's something simultaneously more deliberate and more confounding
While it is a little inspiring the movie doesn't have enough punch to keep an audience interested in something as monotonous as marathon running
We leave the film having learned very little other than that this exceptional long distance runner is certainly quite an athlete
It has neither the compelling authenticity of cinema verite nor the dramatic punch of artful fiction
The Olympics sequences are almost completely devoid of drama and the script never quite makes it clear exactly why he's regarded as being such a special athlete
A very special sports drama about the drive determination and grace of an African athlete who is a hero to young black boys around the world
Without looking away from the unhappy circumstances in which many Africans live today it contrasts the community's material poverty with its spiritual richnessand suggests this may be one of the great lessons that Africa has to teach the West
I've seen Olympic TV profile segments that probe deeper than Endurance
I found the film engrossing missing only the opportunity to spend more time with the mechanics of distance training and perhaps through that to learn how Gebrselassie became the world's best at what he does
Interesting on many levels but doesn't quite show the passion of the human body like Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia or the thrill of the race like the recent Children of Heaven
More analytically inclined will be suspicious of the degree of contrivance involved and the stylistic idealization of Third World poverty
A most enjoyable entry into the romantic comedy sweepstakes we are currently experiencing
With its uneven tone Forget Paris doesn't have enough comedy or heartfelt romance to eclipse its faults
Shamelessly schmaltzy
This movie has such a naked desire to evoke the human condition you want to throw a blanket over it
Billy Crystal can be a genuinely funny guy But why does he insist on having all the marbles
Winger is so good in that one sequence that her less-than-incisive delivery of witticisms is a small price to pay
This film needs any two of more appealing characters bigger laughs or a more sympathetic audience
Since the movie tried to be both serious and comedic having no believable relationships was a real problem
Since the stories are none too startling it's hard to see why these otherwise bright people should be so enthusiastic about boring themselves
Delightfully developed and delivered romantic comedy
Ah did that movie make me feel good
Um roteiro divertido que inova ao investir em um casal de protagonistas mais maduro do que o habitual
It's a funny and touching movie
Mr Crystal's style as a director is smoothe and bland
A very funny movie
Like the relationship it depicts everything goes terribly slack in the middle
A rather sour romantic comedy
Some nice one-liners and a bit of good scenery help the story of a whirlwind romance that turns to salt when she later joins him Stateside
Towards the end you wish they'd just get it over with but this film usually overcomes even the most cynical viewer's resistance
When Harry Met Sally meets Sleepless in Seattle
Life plays more like This Is Your Life for Eddie Murphy cobbling together elements from his earlier funnier movies
Life desperately wants to let Murphy and Lawrence be actors but it can't imagine them as anything more than rowdy showmen
Murphy and Lawrence both give substance to roles as innocents sentenced to life in prison for a murder they didn't commit
has no real sense of period style throwing in scores of distracting anachronisms in both attitudes and dialogue
The well-matched pair make the most of what the makers of Life give them but what the material they are given isn't nearly as inspired as they are
Has a tendency to be marginally entertaining one minute and then brain-numbingly dull and misguided the next
How could these two guys NOT be funny See the movie and find out
The writers and Demme should have smoothed out the timeline and sacrificed a few zingers in order to make a deeper better movie about hardship and friendship in prison
This prison dramedy's muddled episodic script seems to have gone on a hunger strike for humor
A maudlin unfunny mess
Mostly lifeless because deep down it's really about other movies
Formulaic obvious and very slow
An unimaginative plot and a cast of unbelievably wholesome jailbirds
Screenwriters Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone deserve hard time for the tired plodding shtick they concoct once the duo end up in prison stripes
If you're looking for comedy nutrition here you'll find yourself in stand-up anorexic hell
A failed if somewhat noble experiment for the two foul-mouthed comedians
Face it folks Eddie Murphy just ain't funny anymore
No h atuao que resista a um roteiro fraco como o deste filme
Murphy and Lawrence never quite move beyond shtick
Life is a surprise that not only avoids typical trappings but throws in a tinge of the bittersweet as well
You want more
About equal to the original Neither of them were classics
Even the special effects are more to the point of the comedy than they were in the first film For some reason this appears to leave more room for the sort of random funny business that Mr Murray and his friends do best
A few bright moments thanks to the cast
A loose assured sequel that has the breezy ambition of simply being fun and likable And it is
Best forgotten sequel
No one has ever accused Ghostbusters II of being a great film or even a good one for that matter
Bottom line with Murray on fire and enough clever dialogue to rival its predecessor Ghostbusters II is good enough to put post-milennial comedy to shame
Feels like a blueprint concocted by the bean-counters at Columbia Pictures
The film is largely an excuse for a cast get-together with the Ghostbusters under judicial restraining order after the havoc wreaked in part one suffering lives of semi-obscurity
Kids will find the oozing slime and ghastly ghostly apparitions to their liking and adults will enjoy the preposterously clever dialog
A terrible disappointment a shockingly self-satisfied and unforgivably slapdash sequel
There's very little energy in the follow-through and this time Murray's listlessness seems more anemic than comic
Almost as sharp as the first film and only suffering slightly from the inevitable repetitions
A little of a rehash but still good
Frankly Murray Sigourney Weaver and even Aykroyd deserve much better
Effectively slimed everyone's fond memories of the original
Plenty of agreeable nonsense to develop within the larger Ghostbusters universe It's a sincerely amusing movie warmly energized to give fans a steamy second helping of the good stuff
An almost uniformly substandard follow-up that since the original film remains so beloved by so many people still gets to be disappointing even two decades and change later
The sequel is on the whole a fairly mechanical spook show filled with grinning ghosts that are definitely ghoulish but hardly menacing
Explores the human condition with a rare passion
A reasonably exhilarating hybrid of prison movie and courtroom drama
It's a struggle for Bacon -- and I'm not doubting the facts of the matter -- because the part is so clearly designed to knock us out but Bacon is honest in touch with Young's sources or lack of them
Slater who in certain shots looks curiously like Kevin Costner is an actor with talent but he is too young for this role and not confident enough to dial down a little
Though based on a true story this grueling drama is peopled by characters that have been fictionalized into big house cliches
Attempts to masquerade as a historical drama but twists the facts to have them fit the traditional Hollywood courtroom drama
Unsalvageable and inadvertently silly
As a thriller Murder in the First has all the elements but is so flamboyant and overblown that it becomes off-putting quite quickly
An example of what happens when a picture has everything going for it except good writing and good direction
It's a sorry excuse for a serious movie
Woefully over-manipulative and over-the-top
More than likely you will forgive the compromises -- the story of Henri Young needed to be told
The figures are right the investment looks good but the emotional pay-off is minimal
Standard courtroom thriller with two fantastic performances
An arbitrary by-the-numbers courtroomcrime yarn that sometimes shifts between being too preachy and pretentious
O roteiro maniquesta e a direo pesada nada sutil de Rocco comprometem irremediavelmente o filme - que ainda conta com a atuao nada convincente de Slater
Average thriller
It is Bacon's absolutely powerhouse performance that helps make 'Murder' one of the classic prison pictures of all time published --
A must see for Kevin Bacon's performance especially in the early scenes
Moving story of justice but too intense for kids
This film's storyline couldn't be more pedestrian if it tried
Too heavy on talk and too light on fancy footwork
A sufficiently ebullient piece of eye candy that can stand on its own two nimble feet
Will someone please get rid of this genre of dance films
The movie is largely gimmicky melodrama lathered with cheap feel-good sentimentality
Throughout the film Haines treatsbanal moments as epiphanies telegraphing every feeling and thought with annoying coyness
A romantic drama that makes the most of the many fine dance sequences in the storyline
Although the movie bubbles occasionally it never boils
Two hours-plus of melodrama and dancing dancing dancing danczzzz zzzz zzzzzzzz
Competent but predictable soap opera
A great big summer cheeseball of a movie that mildly entertains but doesn't stimulate
When it turns its attention to bodies in motion writhing across the floor to a salsa beat the film is a joy to watch When drama takes center stage which is all too often 'Dance' drags its feet
What is it about dance that most joyous of arts that inspires so many bad movies
A quality film
The use of Plowright as a middle-aged frump wanting to get in on the sexy action is deeply patronizing
Sparkles just like an old-fashioned musical--it's beautifully designed and skillfully directed
Too insubstantial to rise above being anything other than feel-good fluff
For every clich embraced in its entirety another is subverted just enough that you're pleasantly surprised
The real creative opportunities lie in visual and choreographic options and Haines doesn't miss a beat in either department
Upbeat dance-romance is fine for tweens and up
What Jaws did for sharks The Ghost and the Darkness may do for lions
The Ghost and the Darkness isn't bad as a matinee distraction but goodness knows it isn't good either
The main failure of the script is a complete lack of tension
The Ghost And the Darkness keeps you waiting and waiting and waiting and it just never revs up
Can't transcend a too-familiar script
When the movie sticks to fact the result is a hypnotic spectacle
Ranges in quality from adolescent boys' adventure stories to Heart of Darkness
A rousingly effective 'man versus beast' yarn in the great tradition of Jaws and Moby Dick
The picture is too lightweight too posturing and too self-important to go in an introspective direction
A compelling experience because it is true and because it is photographed with such panoramic intensity
Provides us with an unforgettable primal encounter with the mysterious other
Enjoyable and entertaining in a passive sort of way Kilmer's performance makes the film
Excellent thriller Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer are outstanding
An exciting man vs nature adventure that falls short of terrifying because William Goldman's script is too reminiscent of Jaws
Gets a bit weird and boring Both stars can do better
atmospheric but uneven thriller
A roaring adventure
It sounds like it might be a good movie but it ain't
Effectively wipes out the lion's cuddly image from The Lion King and reinstates its rep as the fearsome king of the jungle
A scenery-chewing Michael Douglas is the highlight of this passable landlocked variation of Jaws
The popularity of over-scored let's hug bullshit like Robin Hood predicts the certainty of a one-term George HW presidency better than any number of Gallup polls
More than happy to indulge a few moments of high-flying screen acrobatics Prince delights in the muck -- a divine aesthetic that quickens the pace and hopefully for younger viewers encourages plenty of backyard recreation
As a piece of escapism this deluxe action-heavy -hour-and--minute Robin Hood gets the job done
One of 's biggest hits for reasons increasingly obscure Costner and company struggle desperately to make the Robin Hood legend relevant to contemporary audiences
The familiar fable gets a modern makeover with mixed results
It was good in  It's still good now
In the end and only just barely Robin Hood Prince of Thieves delivers the goods chiefly on the power of a thumpingly vibrant last  minutes and some excellent swordplay choreography
Buckles are truly swashed and derring-do effectively done in this th-century adventure which simply sets out to entertain handsomely and does so with a great deal of dash flash and panache
Costner is not a Robin Hood for the ages but in this expensively mounted production he'll do as a Robin Hood for the summer
With so much money and talent at work here though this latest incarnation of the legend is considerably smaller than the sum of its parts
With a strange mix of varying English and American accents and the weight of a film with too many subplots Robin Hood strains credibility It also feels long
This is a big colorful sharp-witted and beautifully photographed rendering of the tale of the olde English guerrilla fighter -- two solidly entertaining hours
No longer a study in swashbuckling bravura it is a depressive political allegory in which wit is as rare as a ray of sun in the gray British sky
The fight sequences are explosive the physical production is impressive and the supporting performances are full of juice
There's no subtlety in this Robin Hood but subtlety isn't everything Grit and obviousness have coarser charms and the director makes much of these
Its ostensibly canny match of star and subject assures that Robin Hood Prince of Thieves will fill theaters But will it send moviegoers out enthralled The message from this cracked crystal ball is Naaah
It's a slick and sassy attempt to get mileage from a dependable vehicle by wrapping it in as many sure-fire gimmicks as the filmmakers can cram onto the screen
Much as I admire Costner it is the very qualities of honesty honor and sincerity he projects so forcefully that encumber this Robin
While the makers of Robin Hood Prince of Thieves may have set out to bury the poor old duffer of Sherwood Forest in a welter of trendy banter they have ended up burying themselves as well
Robin Hood Prince of Thieves is an entertainment without a particular point of view
